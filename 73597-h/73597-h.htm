<p class="ph2">THE THREE STRINGS</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br>

<small>THE FIRST MOVE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">EVELYN PRESTON ran lightly up the steps
of her home and inserting her latch-key in
the vestibule door, pushed it open just as the
taxi-driver, following more slowly with many an
upward glance at the blind-closed windows, reached
her side.</p>

<p>“Put the suit case down,” she directed. “I’ll
have the front door opened by the time you get
the trunk here.”</p>

<p>The cool if somewhat stale air of the closed
house which met Evelyn as she stepped across the
threshold of the open door was refreshing after
the glare of the asphalt pavements, for Washington
was experiencing one of the hot waves which come
in late September and make that month one to be
avoided in the Capital City.</p>

<p>Evelyn, intent on calling a servant, paused midway<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
in the large hall as the taxi-driver’s bulky
figure blocked the light in the front doorway.
Without waiting for directions he lowered her
motor trunk from his shoulders and stood it against
the wall.</p>

<p>“Shall I leave it here, Miss?” he inquired.</p>

<p>Evelyn, busily engaged in searching for change
in her purse, nodded affirmatively, and the man
propped himself against the door jamb and waited
for his pay.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Miss,” he exclaimed a moment later,
his politeness stimulated by the generous tip which
accompanied Evelyn’s payment of the taxi fare.
“Would you like me to carry your trunk upstairs?”</p>

<p>“No; the butler will take it up, thank you.”
Evelyn’s gesture of dismissal was unmistakable,
and the man hitched uncomfortably at his cap,
glanced furtively up the hall and then back at
Evelyn who, totally unconscious of his scrutiny,
stood impatiently waiting for him to go. He
opened his mouth, but if he intended to address her
again he thought better of it, and with a mumbled
word banged out of the front door.</p>

<p>Evelyn turned at once and sped to the back
stairs, but call as she did, no servant responded
and the blind-closed windows made the passageway
dark and unfriendly. With an impatient exclamation
Evelyn returned to the front hall; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
servants had evidently not arrived from the seashore
to open the house for her.</p>

<p>She stopped only long enough to push her trunk
into the billiard room just off the hall and pick
up her suit case, then she went rapidly upstairs
to her bedroom which, in its summer covered furnishings,
looked very inviting to her tired eyes.
Four nights in a sleeper and three extra hours
added to the tedium of her journey from the west
by a hot-box which had delayed her train’s arrival
in Washington, had made her long for home comforts.</p>

<p>Going over to the windows Evelyn drew up the
blinds and opening the sashes thrust back the
shutters, then, tossing off her hat and coat as she
moved about her bedroom, she finally jerked open
the suit case and tumbled about its contents until
she found the garments she sought. In doing so
she unearthed a letter from her mother, and she
smiled as her eyes caught the words:</p>

<p>“I am sending the servants to the city on the
fifteenth, which gives them a day to open the house
and have it aired before you get there. Now be
sure and reach Washington on the sixteenth.
Your Father will be very angry if——”</p>

<p>The remainder of the sentence was on the opposite
sheet, but Evelyn did not trouble to read further;
instead her slender fingers made mince-meat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
of the letter and as the torn pieces fluttered to the
floor she sighed involuntarily.</p>

<p>Her mother, with her usual inconsistency, had
evidently not troubled to study time-tables in deciding
that her daughter could not reach Washington
by the 15th, and in her own mind Evelyn wondered
if the servants would be dispatched from Chelsea in
time to reach there before night. The importance of
time figured very little in Mrs. Burnham’s indolent
sheltered life; her contention that prompt people
wasted a great deal of time was frequently borne
out by those who waited in impotent wrath for her
to keep her engagements.</p>

<p>Evelyn changed into her dressing gown and then,
sometimes colliding against furniture in the darkened
house, made her way through her mother’s
bedroom and boudoir, her step-father’s suite of
rooms and into the library which opened from his
bedroom, pulling up window shades and letting in
fresh air and sunshine as she went. Back once
more in her own room she tested the electric lights
and was thankful to find the current turned on;
apparently Mrs. Ward, her mother’s housekeeper,
had attended to some of the details of moving back
into their city house.</p>

<p>Encouraged by her success with the electricity,
Evelyn tried the water in the bathroom and finding
it running, filled the tub and with the aid of an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
electric plunger, soon luxuriated in a hot bath.
But upon emerging she did not immediately complete
her toilet, the comfortable lounge exerted too
great an appeal to her weary muscles, and taking a
silk quilt from a nearby cedar chest she settled
down amid soft pillows and was soon in dreamless
slumber.</p>

<p>Some hours later Evelyn awoke. It took her
several minutes to recall where she was as she sat
up rubbing her sleepy eyes. Her windows faced
the west and the afternoon sunshine filled every
cranny of the room. Evelyn consulted her watch—fifteen
minutes past two. With a bound she
was on her feet and a second later was dressing in
haste, her actions stimulated by pangs of hunger.
She had eaten only a modest breakfast on the
train, counting upon a hearty luncheon at home.
She paused long enough in her dressing to go to the
telephone in the library and call up several friends,
only to be told by Central that the telephones she
wanted had been disconnected for the summer.</p>

<p>A trifle discouraged Evelyn returned to her bedroom
and resumed her dressing more slowly.
Whom could she get to go out to tea with her?—Marian
Van Ness. Evelyn brightened, but paused
on her way to the library; what use to telephone,
Marian was probably at the State Department and
would not leave there until five o’clock. She could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
get her to dine with her at the Shoreham, but in
the meantime she was exceedingly hungry and to
wait until seven o’clock—</p>

<p>Evelyn picked up her hat and then laid it down
again as an idea occurred to her. Why not forage
about the kitchen for eatables? The idea appealed
to her the more she considered it. If the servants
did not arrive she could go for Marian, whose
apartment house was around the corner, and they
could dine together; for the present a cup of tea
and a few crackers would stay her appetite.</p>

<p>A few seconds later Evelyn was speeding down
the staircase on her way to the kitchen. A visit
to the butler’s pantry brought to light a package of
crackers concealed in a tin box and a canister of
her mother’s favorite Orange-Peko tea. Tucking
her treasures under her arm Evelyn sought the
kitchen and there to her delight found on investigation
that she could light the big gas range. It
took her but a moment to fill the water kettle, and
humming a song she continued her researches in
the orderly kitchen. An unopened jar of peanut
butter and another of snappy cheese turned up on
one of the shelves, and gathering plates and cooking
utensils together she was soon enjoying toasted
cheese and crackers and a delicious cup of tea.</p>

<p>She was about to refill her cup when the silence
of the sunny kitchen was broken by the imperative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
ringing of the bell. With a joyful exclamation
Evelyn rose to her feet—the servants had come at
last. As she started for the hall door she came
face to face with the room-bell register—the indicator
moved slowly downward and stopped at the
printed word: “Library.”</p>

<p>Evelyn stared at the indicator in perplexity.
Pshaw! the register was out of order; it was the
front door bell which had rung. Stopping long
enough to turn off the gas burning in the range
she hastened upstairs to the front door, only to find
the vestibule empty. She stepped out on the doorstep
and glanced up and down, but except for
a motor vanishing around the corner, the street
was deserted.</p>

<p>Considerably perturbed Evelyn reëntered the
house, and it was some seconds before she mounted
the staircase to the second floor. Her lagging footsteps
were accelerated by the sudden thought that
perhaps her step-father had returned and gone
straight to his room and, supposing from the opened
windows that the servants were downstairs, had
rung for the butler. He always carried his latch-key;
but her mother had mailed her his latch-key!</p>

<p>Evelyn’s hand fell from the portières to her side
and she drew back, then, suppressing her growing
nervousness, she parted the portières and stepped
into the library. She had advanced half across<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
the room before she became aware that a stranger
sat half facing her near the great stone fireplace.</p>

<p>Evelyn retreated precipitously; then, gathering
her wits, she demanded a trifle breathlessly:</p>

<p>“Who are you?”</p>

<p>No reply.</p>

<p>“How did you get here?”</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>“What do you want?”</p>

<p>Her question remained unanswered; and anger
conquering her fright, Evelyn stepped up to the
chair and for the first time obtained a full view of
the stranger’s ashen face and wide-staring eyes.
Instinctively she bent nearer and her hand sought
his pulseless wrist; its icy chill struck her with
terror. With one horrified look into the dead eyes
she fled from the room.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>COMPLICATIONS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">EVELYN never knew how she reached the
front door, but as she dashed out into the
vestibule she almost fell into the arms of a
tall neatly dressed woman standing on the doorstep.
For a breathless second she clung to the
newcomer in silence.</p>

<p>“Matilda!” Only in moments of stress did Evelyn
ever address her mother’s housekeeper by her
first name. “Thank God you are here!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ward gazed at her in alarm. “What’s
wrong, Miss Evelyn?” she asked. “Come inside,
Miss,” coaxingly, growing conscious that Evelyn
was swaying upon her feet. Supporting the half
fainting girl, she led her into the billiard room
which opened from the hall to the right of the
front door. Once in the room Evelyn collapsed on
the nearest chair.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t go,” she begged as Mrs. Ward stepped
toward the hall. “Don’t leave me.”</p>

<p>“Only for a moment, Miss; I left my bag outside
the house,” and Mrs. Ward, disentangling her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
skirt from Evelyn’s clutching fingers, disappeared
into the hall to return shortly with a glass of water
in one hand and her bag in the other. She dropped
the latter on Evelyn’s trunk as she entered the room.</p>

<p>“Take a sip of water, Miss Evelyn,” she said,
retaining her hold of the glass as Evelyn’s attempts
to take it in her shaking hand proved futile. “Are
Jones and the cook here?”</p>

<p>“No.” Evelyn was only equal to monosyllables.</p>

<p>“They haven’t come!” Mrs. Ward looked
shocked. “All the servants were to leave Atlantic
City this morning on the first train. No wonder
you were frightened, Miss Evelyn, all alone in this
big house.”</p>

<p>“But I was not alone.” Evelyn pushed aside the
empty glass; she felt refreshed by the cold water
and the presence of Mrs. Ward restored her to
some degree of composure. “There’s a dead man
upstairs!”</p>

<p>The glass slipped from Mrs. Ward’s hand and
broke on the highly polished floor.</p>

<p>“Are you mad?” Mrs. Ward spoke more
roughly than she realized, and Evelyn’s angry flush
caused her to modify her tone to its customary
civility. “Are you in earnest, Miss Evelyn?”
Evelyn nodded vigorously, and Mrs. Ward’s comely
face paled. “It’s—It’s not Mr. Burnham?”</p>

<p>“No; I have never seen the man before.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>Mrs. Ward stared blankly at Evelyn, then roused
herself. “Hadn’t I better go and investigate?” she
asked. “You may be mistaken, Miss; perhaps the
man’s only asleep.”</p>

<p>Evelyn shivered. “Men don’t sleep with their
eyes open,” she said dully, rising. “I’m coming
with you,” and she quickened her pace to keep up
with Mrs. Ward as the latter led the way upstairs
to the library. Mrs. Ward faltered just inside the
room as her eyes fell on the quiet figure near the
fireplace; then, repressing all emotion, she strode
over to the figure and bent, as Evelyn had done,
and placed her hand on the dead man’s wrist.
When she turned back to Evelyn, who lingered
near the doorway, her face rivaled the young
girl’s in whiteness.</p>

<p>“I’d better go for Dr. Hayden.” She mumbled
the words so that she was forced to repeat them
before Evelyn understood her.</p>

<p>“Try the telephone,” the latter suggested, “that’s
quicker.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ward glanced shrinkingly at the telephone
stand which stood almost at the dead man’s elbow
and shook her head.</p>

<p>“I’d better go,” she reiterated obstinately.</p>

<p>“Nonsense, use the branch telephone in the
pantry.” Evelyn’s customary cool-headedness returned
as she saw the housekeeper becoming demoralized.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
“Hurry, don’t waste any more time,”
she added, and obedient to the stronger will, Mrs.
Ward hastened from the room.</p>

<p>Evelyn stayed by the doorway in indecision, half
inclined to accompany the housekeeper downstairs,
but an attraction she could not conquer drew her
toward the fireplace, and step by step she advanced
nearer the dead man until only a chess table separated
them. Sinking into a chair in front of the
table she stared at the body for a long moment,
then hastily averted her eyes. It was the first time
she had seen death and its majesty over-awed
even her terror.</p>

<p>A clock chiming the quarter aroused her and she
mechanically looked at her wrist watch—a quarter
of five. Had only two hours and a half passed
since she had entered the library to telephone to
Marian Van Ness? The time had seemed interminable,
and she waited in ever increasing nervousness
for the housekeeper’s return, as the clock
ticked off minute after minute with maddening
regularity.</p>

<p>Finally a murmur of voices coming nearer roused
Evelyn and with a subdued exclamation she moved
forward to meet Doctor Lewis Hayden, who a
second later appeared in the library, Mrs. Ward
at his heels.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>“Has Mrs. Ward explained?” she demanded as
Hayden clasped her outstretched hand.</p>

<p>“Only that——” Hayden stopped speaking as his
eyes fell on the dead man. Striding forward he
made a brief inspection before turning to the silent
women. “Tell my chauffeur to go at once for
Doctor Penfield, Mrs. Ward,” he directed and
there was that in his manner which caused the
housekeeper to move with even more than her
customary rapidity. As she disappeared between
the portières, Lewis Hayden turned his attention
to Evelyn.</p>

<p>“A dose of aromatic spirits of ammonia will
make you feel better,” he said kindly, noting the
girl’s strained expression, and as he spoke he
opened his emergency kit and poured the medicine
in a glass. “Just add a little water to this,” he
supplemented, “and then go and lie down. I’ll wait
and see Coroner Penfield and we will take charge
of affairs for you.”</p>

<p>Evelyn sighed with relief as she took the medicine.
“Oh, thank you, doctor,” she exclaimed, “if
you will just——” She stopped speaking as the portières
were pulled back and Mrs. Ward, looking
very much agitated, ushered in a tall man whose
travel-stained appearance did not detract from his
air of distinction. Evelyn stared at him as if
unable to believe her eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>“Mr. Maynard!” she exclaimed. “Dear Mr.
Maynard! Where did you come from?”</p>

<p>Dan Maynard clasped her eagerly extended hand
in both of his.</p>

<p>“Just back from France,” he explained, and at
the sound of his voice Hayden’s memory quickened;
its charm across the footlights had lured him often
to the theater to see the man whose fame as an
actor was international. “I wired Mr. Burnham——”</p>

<p>“Beg pardon,” Mrs. Ward insinuated herself into
the little group by the door. “Your telegram was
forwarded to Chelsea, Mr. Maynard, and Mrs.
Burnham told me to prepare a bedroom for you,
sir. It would have been ready but for this——,”
and the housekeeper’s gesture toward the tragic
figure by the fireplace completed her sentence.</p>

<p>Maynard stared but before Evelyn could offer
any explanation the front door bell rang loudly and
Mrs. Ward hastened to answer it.</p>

<p>“I imagine that is the coroner,” began Hayden,
but an exclamation from Evelyn checked him; in
her excitement she had not grasped the use of the
word “Coroner” before Penfield’s name.</p>

<p>“A coroner! Good gracious, doctor, why send
for him?”</p>

<p>“Because a sudden death cannot be examined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
without his presence,” Hayden explained. “Go
and take your medicine, Evelyn.”</p>

<p>Evelyn’s hesitation was brief; she knew Hayden
of old and that he did not permit disobedience from
his patients.</p>

<p>“Very well, doctor,” she said submissively. “But
first, Mr. Maynard, this is our family physician, Dr.
Hayden,” and as the two men silently shook hands,
she added as she moved toward the door leading
into her step-father’s bedroom, “I’ll be back
shortly.”</p>

<p>Hayden’s surmise that Penfield had arrived
proved correct, and the coroner, listening attentively
to Mrs. Ward’s jumbled remarks as he
mounted the staircase, went at once into the library
and greeted Hayden.</p>

<p>“Apoplexy, Hayden?” he inquired, going toward
the fireplace. “Ah, your aid here——” and Hayden
joined him.</p>

<p>Maynard stood an interested spectator by the
door, uncertain whether he was expected to go or
stay, but as neither physician paid the slightest attention
to him, he decided to remain. A sudden
movement of the coroner’s toward the windows
caused him to step forward and pull the inside
Holland shades up to the top. A grunt of approval
from Penfield greeted the additional light and
Maynard decided to tuck back with the aid of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
chairs the heavy brocaded curtains which, like the
portières, were covered with cretonne to protect
them in the summer months, until the large room
was filled with the remaining daylight.</p>

<p>The room, wainscoted in Flemish oak with open
beams across the high ceiling, was never very bright
as its massive furnishings were somber in shade
and absorbed the light. It was a very livable room,
however, and had the air of being much occupied
even with most of its bric-a-bric put away for the
summer. The high-backed carved oak chairs and
great leather covered lounges all looked comfortable,
and the large center table, smoking stands,
and card tables gave an added air of hospitality.</p>

<p>Suddenly Coroner Penfield rose from his knees
beside the dead man and laid down several instruments
on the chess table. He then glanced narrowly
up and down the room, his glance resting
finally on Dan Maynard, of whose presence he had
been until then apparently unaware.</p>

<p>“I must make some inquiries, Hayden,” he said.
“Who is this gentleman?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Maynard—I beg your pardon,” Hayden
straightened up and faced about. “Didn’t I introduce
you?” he added as the actor approached.
“Mr. Maynard only arrived here a few minutes
before you, Penfield. I’ll call Mrs. Ward, the
housekeeper.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>“She doesn’t know anything,” declared Evelyn
who, entering unperceived a few minutes before,
had overheard the coroner’s request. “I came back
to tell you all about everything.”</p>

<p>“Do you feel equal to it?” asked Hayden, pushing
forward a chair. “Hadn’t you better wait,
Evelyn? You have been under a fearful strain
to have your friend die——” He paused in his rapid
speech as if at a loss for words and Maynard, with
intuitive quickness, detected the physician’s disquietude
under his calm professional manner.
“—your friend die so suddenly,” Hayden finished.</p>

<p>Evelyn did not heed the concluding remark; but
one word had caught her attention.</p>

<p>“Friend! He was no friend of mine,” she declared.
“I never saw the man before.”</p>

<p>Penfield bent forward eagerly. “What’s this—a
stranger, you say? Are you quite sure, Miss
Preston? People’s appearance sometimes alters
after death. Please look at him closely.”</p>

<p>Evelyn hesitated and glanced at Hayden who
signed to her to approach. Obediently she stepped
forward and studied the motionless figure which
had been pushed back by Penfield into much the
same position it had occupied when Evelyn first
discovered it. She judged the man to have been
about thirty-six or forty years of age, and noted
particularly the brilliant blue of his eyes against the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
pallor of his skin. He was clean shaven, and his
under jaw was thrust forward at an obstinate
angle, but whether that was its natural position or
the jaw had dropped forward after death Evelyn
was incapable of knowing.</p>

<p>“I never saw the man before,” she stated finally.</p>

<p>“Ah! Then how came it that he was admitted
to your library?” asked Penfield before Hayden
could speak.</p>

<p>“I really don’t know.” Evelyn looked puzzled.
“I presume he got in like any other burglar.”</p>

<p>“Burglar!” Penfield started and turning, stared
again at the dead man. “Burglars don’t as a rule
dress so well; besides, his hands——” He leaned
over and held up the man’s limp right hand, turning
it over so that all could see the long tapering
fingers and well cared for nails.</p>

<p>Maynard studied the hand intently; he had seen
its type when traveling among the silent and
secretive peoples of the Orient and occasionally
met the same type among the deep thinkers and
analytical men and women of Europe who rarely
forget an injury but are patient with the patience
of power conveyed by knowledge and mysticism.</p>

<p>“His finger-prints may give us some clue to his
identity,” added Coroner Penfield, laying down the
hand. “In the meantime——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>“Why not examine the man’s pockets?” suggested
Maynard practically.</p>

<p>Penfield carried out the suggestion with a deftness
which won the actor’s admiration, but all he
brought to light was a piece of string.</p>

<p>“Every pocket empty,” he announced. “And apparently
not even a coat-label—strange!” He cast
a penetrating look at Evelyn. “Why did you not
notify us sooner, Miss Preston?”</p>

<p>“Sooner?” echoed Evelyn. “I started to go for
Dr. Hayden after finding this—this——” Evelyn
choked; she was very near to tears and Penfield’s
grave manner was beginning to impress her unfavorably.
“I met Mrs. Ward, our housekeeper,
on the front steps, brought her up here, and then
sent her to telephone to Dr. Hayden. That hasn’t
been more than an hour ago,” turning for confirmation
to Hayden who nodded his agreement. “I
only arrived in Washington this morning, Dr. Penfield,
and—and—I was all alone in the house. He—he,”—pointing
to the dead man—“he might have
murdered me if he hadn’t died of apoplexy.”</p>

<p>Hayden, who had followed Evelyn’s statements
with ever increasing interest, looked a trifle nonplussed
as he glanced at his colleague who was
winding the string, taken from the dead man’s
pocket, in and out among his fingers.</p>

<p>“You say you arrived at the house this morning,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
Miss Preston,” began Penfield slowly, “and you
did not enter this library until this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“I did, too,” contradicted Evelyn. “I came in
here in the morning and opened the blinds; I did
the same thing all over this floor so as to air the
house, and——” She added as Hayden started to
interrupt her, “I came into this room again about
half past two——”</p>

<p>“And you sent for us about five o’clock,” commented
Penfield dryly. “Your remarks are inconsistent—you
previously stated you sent for us at
once on finding the body——”</p>

<p>“The body was not here at half past two,” declared
Evelyn.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t!” chorused the two physicians, while
Maynard looked eagerly at Evelyn and back at
them.</p>

<p>“Come, Miss Preston,” began Penfield. “You
must be mistaken.”</p>

<p>“I am not,” Evelyn’s foot came down with a
stamp. “I used that telephone there, right by the
fireplace; do you suppose I could have done so and
not become aware that a dead man was sitting by
my elbow? I tell you the man wasn’t dead then.”</p>

<p>The silence which followed was broken by Coroner
Penfield.</p>

<p>“Miss Preston,” he stated quietly. “That man
has been dead at least twelve hours.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>Evelyn stared at him in growing horror. “Dead—twelve
hours!” she gasped. “Then who rang the
library bell at four o’clock?”</p>

<p>They gazed at each other, but before any one
could speak the sound of a heavy fall caused them
to wheel about—Mrs. Ward had fainted just inside
the portières of the room.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>UNIDENTIFIED</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Maître d’hôtel, returning from an inspection
of the main dining room, paused
in Peacock Alley to view with an appraising
eye the men and women who promenaded up and
down or sat about, some waiting with good grace
for their chance to find a disengaged table in one
of the dining rooms while others, outwardly rebellious,
expressed their candid opinion of Washington
in war-time. Suddenly the Frenchman’s air of
polite indifference changed to one of alertness as
a man pushed his way through the throng and
stopped near the door of the Palm Room. The
Maître d’hôtel was at his elbow instantly.</p>

<p>“Ah, Monsieur Burnham, welcome, most welcome,”
he said. “Have you had a nice summaire?”</p>

<p>“Henri!” Peter Burnham surrendered his hat
and cane to a waiting attendant. “The summer
has been so-so,” he added, turning back to the
Frenchman. “I am waiting for Mr. James Palmer;
have you seen him this evening?”</p>

<p>“But yes.” The Maître d’hôtel wormed his way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
into the Palm Room and beckoned to Burnham to
follow. “There, in that corner across the room;
this way,” and he darted among the tables and the
palms, Burnham following closely, until he reached
a small table set for two persons, and pulled out
the unoccupied chair.</p>

<p>Palmer looked up from the menu he was studying
and greeted Burnham with warmth.</p>

<p>“Have a Martini?” he inquired as their waiter
hurried up and the Maître d’hôtel went back to his
post in the doorway.</p>

<p>“Yes, and make it dry,” cautioned Burnham to
the waiter. “And hurry it along. I am worn out,”
he added to his host.</p>

<p>Palmer glanced at him in concern. “You don’t
look very fit,” he admitted. “Had a bad trip
down?”</p>

<p>“Devilish! Our train was sidetracked for hours
waiting to let troop trains pass; nothing to eat——”
Burnham paused to empty his glass of ice water.
“At our rate of progress I was willing to believe
we’d gone back to stage-coach days, but Washington
is an eye-opener; I had no idea this place
swarmed with people.”</p>

<p>“Washington’s ‘sleepy hollow’ has had a rude
awakening,” remarked Palmer cynically. “I don’t
mind confessing I am weary of seeing consequential
looking people dash about Washington with an air<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
of having arrived just in time to save the Nation.
Washington <i>was</i> on the map before Uncle Sam
started on this war-path.”</p>

<p>Burnham laughed. “I confess I share your outraged
feelings; had to wait interminably at the
Union Station before I could telephone you.” He
stopped to take the cocktail at that instant placed
before him. “Here’s how!”</p>

<p>His host raised his glass in acknowledgment and
sipped his Martini with due enjoyment.</p>

<p>“Better have another,” he suggested as Burnham
set down his empty glass, “against the time Washington
goes dry.”</p>

<p>“I’ve stocked up my wine cellar with that in
view,” admitted Burnham and stopped to watch
some newcomers who had taken possession of the
nearest table. “I suppose I can get a room here
for the night in case I find the servants haven’t
arrived to open our house.”</p>

<p>“My dear Burnham!” Palmer looked actually
shocked. “Empty rooms are unheard of in Washington.”</p>

<p>“How about club chambers?”</p>

<p>“Nothing doing; they are even sleeping in the
bathtubs there,” laughed Palmer, and stopped speaking
as the orchestra in the mezzanine gallery commenced
to play and, dinner arriving at that instant,
the two men, except for monosyllabic remarks now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
and then, completed the meal in silence. As Burnham
took one of the cigars proffered him he pushed
aside his dessert plate, planted his elbows on the
table, and leaned forward.</p>

<p>“I can’t understand why people want an orchestra
playing while they eat,” he grumbled. “I don’t
enjoy having to shout when I talk.”</p>

<p>“Well, I suggested dining at the club——”</p>

<p>“I know, I know; but I forgot about the beastly
orchestra,” he paused to puff abstractedly at his
cigar.</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble, Burnham?” asked Palmer
quickly. “Is your wife ill?”</p>

<p>“No, no; it’s——” He bent nearer his companion,
then paused to shoot a glance over his shoulder and
his confidences remained unspoken. “Jove! Evelyn!”
he ejaculated. “She wasn’t due here until
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Palmer, but half catching his remark, followed
his gaze and saw Evelyn Preston and her friend
Marian Van Ness just taking their seats at a table
some distance away. Palmer pushed back his
chair preparatory to rising.</p>

<p>“Bless my soul, Burnham,” he exclaimed impulsively.
“Why didn’t you tell me Evelyn was with
you? We could have waited dinner for her and
Mrs. Van Ness. Here—” beckoning to their waiter—“tell
those ladies——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>“Wait,” broke in Burnham. “We’ve finished,
Palmer; suppose we go over and sit at their table,
but there’s no hurry, man.”</p>

<p>Burnham’s tone was so petulant that Palmer,
curbing his impatience to be with Evelyn, subsided
in his seat and gazed at him in speculative silence.
What had come over easy-going, absent-minded
Peter Burnham? Six weeks had passed since his
visit to Burnham Lodge at Chelsea, and that the
six weeks had not agreed with Burnham was plain
to be seen; his cheeks were a bad color and he
seemed to Palmer’s appraising eye to have shrunk
in his clothes. A certain nervous tremor in the
hand holding his cigar also was noticeable, and
Palmer wracked his brain to recall some incident of
his stay at Burnham Lodge which might give him
the key to Burnham’s altered demeanor. But to
the best of his recollection all had been harmonious,
and he had been rather a captious guest, for his
prediction that the marriage would not turn out a
happy one had put him on the alert for matrimonial
discords.</p>

<p>Palmer had not been alone in predicting a disastrous
ending to the marriage, for all Washington
had heard first with incredulity and then laughter
of the engagement of the wealthy widow, Lillian
Preston, to Peter Burnham, a man considerably her
junior, who had been uniformly unfortunate in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
every business venture he had undertaken. Peter
had his good points, his friends contended, and as
one of them remarked at the wedding which had
followed swiftly upon the announcement of the
engagement, his wife could keep him in the style
he had been accustomed to before his final financial
venture had landed him in bankruptcy.</p>

<p>That Mrs. Burnham was honestly devoted to her
husband and admired him, Palmer had come to
believe. She was not a woman given to concealing
her thoughts, her habit of plain speech frequently
landing her in hot water. Peter Burnham was
well read, polished in manner, a born <i>raconteur</i>,
and a devoted chess player; he cared very little for
out-door sports and his greatest hardship was being
dragged to horseshows of which his wife was inordinately
fond, having inherited her love for
horses from her Kentucky ancestors.</p>

<p>Society had speculated as to how Mrs. Burnham’s
young daughter and only child would take her
mother’s second marriage, but as Evelyn was then
away at boarding school, society found little to
build gossip upon. Evelyn’s début the winter before
had revived interest in the subject, and when
she left Washington early in the spring for an indefinite
visit in the West, tongues had wagged without,
however, getting any satisfaction from Mr. and
Mrs. Burnham who went placidly on their way,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
being entertained and entertaining in their hospitable
home in the fashionable Northwest.</p>

<p>The situation had decidedly piqued Palmer’s
interest, for as intimate as was his footing in the
Burnham home he had never been able to decide
Evelyn’s status in the family circle; she was
frequently and pleasantly alluded to in conversation,
but that was all. He had made no secret of
his desire to marry Evelyn, and that both husband
and wife favored his courtship he had ample reason
to believe, though neither to his knowledge had
outwardly espoused his cause to Evelyn.</p>

<p>When called on the telephone about six o’clock
that afternoon Burnham had given Palmer to
understand that he was alone in Washington; and
yet his young step-daughter was also in the city.
It was of course possible that Evelyn was visiting
Marian Van Ness. Palmer frowned; he disliked
few people, but he most heartily disliked brilliant
Marian Van Ness; their natures were too utterly
foreign for them ever to be congenial.</p>

<p>Palmer transferred his attention from Burnham
to the latter’s step-daughter and her companion,
both of whom were busily engaged in discussing the
menu. Marian Van Ness’ dark beauty was an
effectual foil for Evelyn’s curly yellow hair and
blue eyes. The entrance of both girls, for Marian
appeared little more, in their smart summer costumes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
had attracted admiring low voiced comment
from the other diners in their vicinity, and several
friends and acquaintances had looked up to bow
or wave their hands to them, for Marian was extremely
popular in society. When financial reverses
had obliged her to find employment upon her
return to her native city after her divorce, she
had acted as social secretary for several Cabinet
officers’ wives and through their influence had received
an appointment in the State Department five
years before.</p>

<p>Suddenly Palmer stirred in his chair. “I hardly
think Mrs. Van Ness is a staid enough chaperon
for Evelyn,” he remarked. “Suppose we join
them,” and leaving Burnham no option in the
matter he pushed back his chair and rose.</p>

<p>Evelyn, whose healthy young appetite had asserted
itself, in spite of the tragic happenings of
that afternoon, had been chiefly occupied in selecting
the most tempting dishes in the menu, and it
was not until an exclamation from Marian drew
her attention to her step-father coming toward
them, Palmer’s big proportions towering behind
him, that she knew of his presence in the dining
room. At that moment the diners at an intervening
table left their seats, thereby impeding Burnham’s
progress, and only Marian caught Evelyn’s low exclamation
and noticed her change of color.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>“Are you going to faint?” she asked. “Drink
some water, dear.”</p>

<p>Instead Evelyn laid trembling fingers on her cool
palm.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget your promise,” she pleaded. “Remember,
you are going to stay with me....”</p>

<p>“I will.” Marian’s firm hand-clasp was reassuring.
“Can’t you tell me more of what took place
this afternoon?”</p>

<p>“Not now.” Evelyn straightened up and turned
to meet her step-father and, with a poise and air of
cordiality which Marian secretly applauded, she
held out her hand in greeting to Burnham and then
to Palmer. “When did you get here?” she inquired
as the men took the chairs proffered by attentive
waiters, after first speaking to Marian.</p>

<p>“I might ask the same of you,” retorted Burnham.
“You were not due here until to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I found I could take an earlier train,” responded
Evelyn. “Why didn’t you and Mother come up to
the house when you arrived?”</p>

<p>“Your mother didn’t come down with me,” answered
Burnham, waving away the waiter’s offer
of a menu. “She is in New York.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” The ejaculation slipped from Evelyn followed
by another: “Oh, waiter, don’t remove that
place,” as the servant started to clear away the
extra silver and glass. “I am expecting another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
guest,” she added as Palmer, thinking she did not
know that he had dined, imagined she referred to
him and started to decline.</p>

<p>“Another guest?” questioned Burnham and his
manner sharpened. “Whom do you mean?”</p>

<p>Evelyn shot a half resentful glance at him, then
curbing her hot temper which his censorious air
and manner invariably aroused, she answered cheerily.
“None other than your old friend, Dan
Maynard.”</p>

<p>“Maynard in town!” exclaimed Burnham in
pleased surprise.</p>

<p>“Not only in town but he is stopping at our
house,” rattled on Evelyn, noting with some surprise
that Marian had permitted her “Honey-dew”
melon to be taken away uneaten. “The servants
are putting the house in order.”</p>

<p>“Upon my word!” Burnham polished his eye
glasses and looked through them at Evelyn.
“Where is Mrs. Ward?”</p>

<p>“Ill,” tersely. “Dr. Hayden is looking after her;
and Marian is coming back to help me take care
of her.”</p>

<p>Burnham stared at his step-daughter. “Mrs.
Ward ill—what next? When did you and she
arrive in Washington, Evelyn?”</p>

<p>Palmer, stopping his exchange of small talk with
Marian, glanced at Evelyn and her expression<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
caused his interest to quicken. Evelyn was not
used to subterfuge and the look she had favored
her step-father with was indicative of her feelings.</p>

<p>“We didn’t come together,” she explained.
“Mrs. Ward only arrived this afternoon, while I
reached the house——” She stopped to help herself
to beefsteak and several vegetables.</p>

<p>“Yes,” prompted Burnham, and his restless
glance passed from one companion to the other.
“You reached——” A hand was laid on his shoulder
and Maynard cut into the conversation.</p>

<p>“Found at last,” laughed the actor. “Evelyn,
you told me to meet you at the Shoreham and I
have been waiting there until it dawned on me to
try this hotel. How are you, Burnham, and
Palmer, too,” shaking hands as the men rose.</p>

<p>“Marian, have you met Mr. Maynard—Mrs.
Van Ness?” asked Evelyn, and Maynard turned to
encounter a pair of dark brown eyes raised to him
in earnest appeal. The next instant Marian’s hand
was taken in a warm clasp and slowly released as
Palmer made room for Maynard to sit between
them.</p>

<p>“My wife will be delighted to know you have
arrived in Washington,” said Burnham. “She was
overjoyed when your telegram came stating you
might get here any moment. What brings you
back to this country, Maynard?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>“War work,” began Maynard. “No, no soup,”
he broke off to say to the waiter. “Bring me whatever
Miss Preston has ordered. Palmer, I hear
you have your hands full with government contracts
for erecting temporary office buildings here
and at cantonments.”</p>

<p>“All architects are busy these days,” replied
Palmer, accepting another cigar from Burnham.
“In fact every one is busy; I imagine you have
your hands full at the State Department, Mrs.
Van Ness.”</p>

<p>Marian, directly addressed, looked up from the
bread pellets she was arranging in a neat pile before
her. “Well rather, we work night and day.”</p>

<p>“It must be a terrific strain,” acknowledged
Maynard. “So much responsibility rests in the
State Department.” There was a haunting quality
in Maynard’s voice which, no matter how trivial
his remark, impressed his listeners, and Marian’s
heart beat fast as memory of other scenes rose to
torment her, but her manner indicated only polite
attention and after a fraction of a second Maynard
continued his remarks.</p>

<p>“Washington is a changed city,” he stated. “The
Shoreham reminded me particularly of Paris in its
military appearance, except that the uniforms are
not worn and faded. By the way, Burnham,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
among the French officers I met there was René La
Montagne.”</p>

<p>“René!” The startled exclamation escaped Evelyn
before she could check it; and her confusion
was so great that she failed to observe the lowered
looks of two of her companions. Burnham and
Palmer exchanged glances, then their eyes dropped
to their cigars and they smoked in silence.</p>

<p>As Evelyn set down her goblet of water a page
stopped at her elbow.</p>

<p>“A telephone has just come from your butler,
Miss Preston,” he explained, “to ask you to return
home. He said Mrs. Ward was quite ill.”</p>

<p>Evelyn pushed aside her plate. “I’ll go at once,”
she announced. “But the rest of you need not
come until later.”</p>

<p>“I have finished.” As she spoke Marian rose
and Maynard also tossed aside his napkin and
stood up.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” remonstrated Burnham.
“We’ll all go with you, Evelyn. Here, waiter,
bring me the check, and, Maynard, engage a touring
car outside, will you?”</p>

<p>Nodding assent, the actor sped on his errand,
leaving the others to follow more slowly. He was
fortunate in securing a seven-passenger car, and
Burnham bundled his party into it with small ceremony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>“We are right in your neighborhood,” he said
as Palmer drew back, “the car can leave you after
it has taken us home. There’s plenty of room,
Palmer, jump in.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” suggested Evelyn, “it would expedite
matters to stop for Dr. Hayden.”</p>

<p>“If he is not at your house I can go for him and
bring him right over,” answered Palmer, and Burnham
agreed.</p>

<p>“Good idea,” he said shortly. “I hope I am not
crowding you, Evelyn?” as she shrank against
Marian in making room for him on the back seat.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” she replied and sat silent, grateful for
the cool night air which fanned her cheeks. She
had tried to forget the mysterious tragedy while
in the hotel; had even barely mentioned it to Marian
when she picked her up at her apartment to take
her out to dinner, but the sudden summons home
had brought it vividly before her. Suddenly she
caught Maynard’s eyes and his cheery smile gave
her a sense of comfort. As the car turned into
Connecticut Avenue he leaned forward and addressed
Marian Van Ness.</p>

<p>“Are you warm enough?” he asked solicitously.
“You have no extra wrap and the night air is
chilly.”</p>

<p>Marian looked at him then glanced away. “I am
very comfortable,” she murmured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>Palmer, who had chosen to take the vacant seat
by the chauffeur in preference to trusting his weight
on one of the small pivot chairs in the tonneau of
the machine, addressed Burnham several times, but
apparently his words were drowned in the rush of
wind occasioned by the speed of the car, for Burnham
made no response. A short time later the car
drew up to the curb, and stopped before the
Burnham residence.</p>

<p>Maynard was the first out of the machine and
turned at once to help Marian. For a brief second
her hand rested lightly on his arm, then was removed
as she sprang to the sidewalk. Evelyn was
no less quick in getting out and, not waiting to see
what became of the others, she caught Marian by
the elbow and hurried her into the house and upstairs.</p>

<p>Burnham was slower than the others in leaving
the car. “Wait a second, Palmer,” he said, “I’ll
send word if we need Dr. Hayden,” and, turning,
he accompanied Maynard up the steps. His words
were overheard by the anxious faced butler who
had been on the outlook for the car and opened
the front door when it first drew up to the curb.</p>

<p>“The doctor’s here, sir,” and Maynard was quick
to detect the faint, very faint trace of accent in the
man’s subdued voice.</p>

<p>Burnham faced about and called to Palmer:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
“Don’t wait, Palmer, thanks; Hayden is here. See
you to-morrow,” and he waved his hand in farewell
as the car moved off.</p>

<p>“Come in the billiard room, Maynard,” he said
turning to his companion. “We might as well have
a game until Hayden comes down——”</p>

<p>“Just a moment, sir,” broke in Jones, the butler.
“There’s several gentlemen waiting to see you.”</p>

<p>Burnham halted. “Their names——”</p>

<p>A man standing in the shadow of the drawing
room door came forward.</p>

<p>“Detective Mitchell, sir, of the Central Office,”
he said politely. “I was sent to investigate the
case of the man found dead here this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“A man found dead here!” shouted Burnham,
stepping backward and colliding against Maynard.
“Who is he?”</p>

<p>“We don’t know,” acknowledged Mitchell. “But
we are trying to establish his identity. Your step-daughter
found him in the library.”</p>

<p>Burnham stared at the detective wide-eyed.
Suddenly he took out his handkerchief and mopped
his forehead.</p>

<p>“A dead man here!” he ejaculated feebly. “An
unknown man?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps if you will step in here you may be
able to help us identify him,” suggested Mitchell.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
“We have brought the body down into the billiard
room preparatory to taking it to the morgue.”</p>

<p>It seemed almost as if Burnham did not comprehend
what the detective was saying, and but for
Maynard’s guiding hand he would not have found
his way into the room. The body lay on the
billiard table covered by a sheet. Stepping forward,
Mitchell pulled down the sheet, signing to
Burnham to step nearer, and both he and Maynard
watched Burnham as he bent over the body. After
what seemed an interminable time to Maynard, he
straightened up.</p>

<p>“I have no idea who he is,” Burnham stated.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>A QUESTION OF TIME</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">TWENTY-FOUR hours had passed since
Evelyn Preston’s discovery of the dead man,
and the Burnham household had returned
somewhat to its normal condition, chiefly through
Dr. Hayden’s soothing influence and sound advice
which had proved an effectual check to the servants’
inclination to hysteria, Burnham’s temper, and
Evelyn’s nervousness. Marian Van Ness, in lieu
of a trained nurse, had spent the night with the
housekeeper, Mrs. Ward, who had finally quieted
down under the influence of bromides and toward
morning slept heavily. In the few remaining
hours Marian had thrown herself on the couch in
the housekeeper’s sitting room and snatched a short
nap before going to her work at the State Department.</p>

<p>To Evelyn the day had seemed never ending;
she had gone out for part of the morning, returned
for luncheon, and afterward had attempted to rest,
but she was far too restless to remain long in one
place, and about four o’clock in the afternoon she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
found herself in the drawing room gazing moodily
out of the window, her knitting needles for once
idle in her lap. The entrance of Jones with the
tea roused her from her contemplation of the
closed house of her opposite neighbor across the
street.</p>

<p>“Not many people are back yet, Jones,” she remarked.</p>

<p>“Not in this section, Miss Evelyn,” answered the
butler, wheeling forward the tea-wagon and then
going for a nest of tables from which he extracted
the smallest. “Every house is closed hereabouts;
it’s sort of lonesome, Miss, and strange, too, with
the business part and the other streets just packed
with people. Has Mr. Burnham returned yet,
Miss?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so.” Evelyn rattled the teacups as
she rearranged them. “Are you quite positive,
Jones, that no one called me on the telephone while
I was out this morning?”</p>

<p>“Quite, Miss. I followed your instructions and
stayed where I could hear the telephone bell if it
rang; no one called, Miss.”</p>

<p>Jones had made the same answer to the same
question at least six times during the day, but he
was too well trained a servant to betray his curiosity
aroused by Evelyn’s absent-minded harping on the
subject. Being of a somewhat morbid tendency he,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
of all the household, had been the only one to get
some entertainment out of the tragedy. The presence
of the physicians, morgue attendants, and detectives
had thrilled him beyond words; he had
never hoped to participate in a humble degree in
what promised to be a mystifying and unusual case
of sudden death.</p>

<p>“Dr. Hayden went upstairs to see Mrs. Ward
just now,” he said, finding that Evelyn asked no
more questions. She looked up quickly and set
down the tea-pot.</p>

<p>“Is the doctor still here?”</p>

<p>“I think so, Miss.”</p>

<p>“Then run upstairs, Jones, and ask him to stop
here for a cup of tea on his way out, and—eh, just
see if Mr. Burnham is in his room or the library.”</p>

<p>“Very good, Miss Evelyn,” and the butler departed
with alacrity. He had just reached the
floor above when he encountered the busy surgeon
hurrying downstairs. Hayden paused only long
enough to hear his message and then continued on
his way to the drawing room. Evelyn greeted his
entrance with a warm smile of welcome.</p>

<p>“Thanks, no tea,” he said drawing up a chair.
“I will have a glass of water and some sandwiches.
Did you lie down as I advised?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I couldn’t sleep.” Evelyn’s hand shook<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
as she offered him the plate of sandwiches and
Hayden scanned her with concern.</p>

<p>“Don’t go too long on your nerves, Evelyn,” he
cautioned. “Pull up while you can; rest and quiet
are what you need.”</p>

<p>Evelyn moved impatiently. “I’m all right,” she
announced obstinately. “Tell me, doctor, what is
the matter with Mrs. Ward?”</p>

<p>“Oh, she is suffering from shock and hysteria;
in a day or so she will be up and about again.”
Dr. Hayden took a tea biscuit. “In the meantime
bed is the best place for her.”</p>

<p>“What made her go to pieces?” demanded Evelyn,
lowering her voice. “She is a strong healthy
woman and in the three years she has been with
us I have never known her to have a day’s illness.”</p>

<p>“Shock,” replied Hayden tersely.</p>

<p>“But—but she only saw the body just as I did,”
objected Evelyn. “I didn’t faint from shock, and
I don’t pretend to be as strong as she is.”</p>

<p>Hayden mentally contrasted her slender, delicate
appearance and the housekeeper’s tall angular, raw
boned frame and silently agreed with her; the contrast
was too great to admit of argument.</p>

<p>“Tell me, Evelyn,” and he, too, sunk his voice.
“Exactly when did Mrs. Ward join you here yesterday?”</p>

<p>“I found her standing in the vestibule just after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
I discovered that poor dead man upstairs; in fact
when I was on my way to you. Frankly,” Evelyn
smiled apologetically, “my first impulse was to
get out of the house.”</p>

<p>“A very natural impulse,” said a voice behind
them and wheeling about Hayden saw Maynard approaching.
“Sorry to startle you, Evelyn,” the
latter added as she spilled her tea in her sudden
jump. “I am so accustomed to these rubber heels
that I forget others are not. Afternoon, Hayden.
How’s your patient?”</p>

<p>“She is much better.” The physician moved back
to make room for Maynard who paused long
enough to drag forward a large arm chair and
seated himself next to Evelyn.</p>

<p>“Good,” he exclaimed in response to Hayden’s
statement, and at the sympathetic inflection and the
hearty ring in his voice Evelyn brightened. Maynard’s
robust personality brought a touch of the
out-of-doors into the room and dispelled her morbid
thoughts. “Burnham asked me to tell you, Evelyn,
that he would not be here for tea. He is greatly
concerned about Mrs. Ward,” Maynard continued,
addressing Hayden. “Seemed to think last night
from her rambling talk that she was in for a long
illness, brain fever, or something.”</p>

<p>Hayden smiled. “Nothing like that,” he said.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
“Mrs. Ward will soon be on her feet again, little
the worse for her upset.”</p>

<p>“I hope so truly,” exclaimed Evelyn, handing
Maynard his cup and a biscuit. “Not only for her
sake, but because Mother is so dependent upon
her.”</p>

<p>“Has Mrs. Ward been with you long?” inquired
Maynard.</p>

<p>“A little over three years.” Evelyn paused to
consider. “She came to us about six months before
Mother’s marriage to Mr. Burnham; I was at
boarding school that winter.”</p>

<p>“What is Mrs. Ward’s nationality?” asked Hayden.
“I ask because last night just before going
under the influence of the bromides she used several
phrases which——”</p>

<p>A heavy step on the hardwood floor interrupted
the physician and Jones appeared at Evelyn’s side.</p>

<p>“Detective Mitchell to see you, Miss Evelyn,” he
announced and his low voice held suppressed excitement.</p>

<p>“Oh!” Evelyn gazed at him blankly for a minute,
then at her companions; their presence would
surely check any undue inquisitiveness which the
detective might evince. Her step-father had told
her that she might possibly have to appear at the
inquest or give her deposition, and he had cautioned
her against making any statement to either of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
detectives who were then in the house. Evelyn,
rather startled by his grave manner, had promptly
vanished out of the house by way of the back door
while the men from the Central Office were
interviewing Burnham.</p>

<p>“Show him in,” she directed, and as the butler
retreated, she looked at Hayden. “You were saying;
oh, yes, now I remember; you asked about
Mrs. Ward—she was born in Switzerland, but I
believe has lived in the United States since she
was fifteen years old. Is this Mr. Mitchell?” raising
her voice as a well dressed, pleasant-faced man
appeared in the room.</p>

<p>The detective advanced to the little group and
his bow included them all.</p>

<p>“It is, Miss Preston,” he answered. “I was
sorry not to see you this morning before you left.”
Maynard, who had risen on his entrance, pushed
forward his chair for the detective and subsided
into one somewhat in the shadow of the grand
piano. Mitchell acknowledged the courtesy with a
word of thanks, then turned to Dr. Hayden.</p>

<p>“The nurse permitted me to see Mrs. Ward for
a moment, doctor,” he began, “but she said she
knew nothing of the suicide.”</p>

<p>“Suicide!” ejaculated Evelyn, startled.</p>

<p>“I am quoting Mrs. Ward,” explained Mitchell.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
“She evidently believes the stranger’s death to have
been a case of suicide.”</p>

<p>“But how can she? She heard me tell Coroner
Penfield that some one rang the library bell about
five or six minutes before I found the body, and
according to Coroner Penfield the man had been
dead about twelve hours. Yet the body was not
in the library when I was in it earlier in the afternoon;
some one beside myself was in this house,”
declared Evelyn and she came to a breathless and
bewildered pause.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Ward heard you make these statements?”
asked Mitchell, pencil in hand, and his memorandum
pad balanced on one knee.</p>

<p>“Why, I take it for granted that she did,” Evelyn
looked puzzled. “She fainted just about then and
we found her lying inside the library door, didn’t
we, doctor?” Hayden nodded. “Mrs. Ward must
have been standing behind the portières and
couldn’t help overhearing our conversation.”</p>

<p>“Then you conclude that your remark about the
ringing of the library bell caused her to faint,”
asked Maynard reflectively.</p>

<p>Evelyn wrinkled her brows and rubbed her forehead
vigorously. “I don’t know just what to
think,” she acknowledged. “What was there in
that statement to shock her?”</p>

<p>Hayden leaned forward. “Could it be——” He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
began, then broke off abruptly, hesitated, and finally
addressed Mitchell. “Did you think to ask Mrs.
Ward if she saw any one leave this house as she
came up the street?”</p>

<p>“No, doctor. The fact is,” Mitchell completed
the entry he was making in his note book, “the
fact is the nurse would only let me stay a second in
the sick room; she said Mrs. Ward was too ill to
be interviewed now.”</p>

<p>“Then I see nothing for it but to wait until Mrs.
Ward is better,” commented Maynard. “Will
there be an inquest, Mitchell?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; but not just now.” Mitchell turned his
head so as to face Maynard. “However, our investigation
cannot wait; we must sift evidence to present
at the inquest and secure expert testimony.”</p>

<p>Maynard thrust his hands in his pockets and
leaned back. “Go slow, Mitchell,” he cautioned.
“Remember the legal warning: ‘All evidence is
made up of testimony, but all testimony is not
evidence.’”</p>

<p>“True, sir; but in this case the police have reasonable
grounds to suspect a crime has been committed,”
protested Mitchell. “Take Miss Preston’s
testimony for example; she heard the library bell
ring, went upstairs, and found a dead man sitting
in the library.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>“Well, he could have rung the bell before drinking
the poison,” retorted Maynard.</p>

<p>“Be reasonable, Mr. Maynard.” The detective’s
irritation at Maynard’s continued questioning
showed in his heightened color. “Coroner Penfield’s
testimony proved the man had been dead at
least twelve hours.”</p>

<p>“There you go again with your testimony,”
Maynard laughed shortly. “Come, doctor, at what
moment does <i>rigor mortis</i> appear?”</p>

<p>“In a general way, I should say——” Hayden
considered before continuing, “<i>rigor mortis</i> appears
from the third to the sixth hour, and it affects the
muscles of the jaw first.” Evelyn shuddered as
sudden unbidden memory of the dead man’s features
returned to her.</p>

<p>“And how long does rigidity continue?” demanded
Maynard.</p>

<p>“Oh, its duration may average twenty-four to
forty-eight hours; it may, however, last for a few
hours only, in other cases it persists for five, six,
or seven days,” answered Hayden.</p>

<p>“And you physicians are prepared to swear from
<i>rigor mortis</i> as to the exact hour the man died?”
persisted Maynard.</p>

<p>“We are prepared to swear to nothing of the
sort.” Hayden was commencing to share Mitchell’s
irritation at Maynard’s slightly contemptuous manner.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
“We can say if rigidity is complete, that death
is recent. Personally, I believe that <i>rigor mortis</i>
can teach us nothing of scientific value in cases of
poisoning.”</p>

<p>“But there are other tests to establish the time
of death,” broke in the detective. “There’s the
cooling of the body.”</p>

<p>“Don’t!” Evelyn held up a protesting hand. “I
can’t forget the icy chill of his wrist when I touched
him.”</p>

<p>“There!” Mitchell looked triumphantly at Hayden.
“Doesn’t the body cool in about twelve
hours?”</p>

<p>“It might be said to be quite cold in that time,”
replied Hayden. “But the average time taken in
cooling is from fifteen to twenty hours.”</p>

<p>“Your first statement will do for me,” Mitchell
jotted down some figures. “Let me see, Miss Preston,
you found the body about half past three?”</p>

<p>“Yes, or perhaps a few minutes later.”</p>

<p>“Humph! Then it is a safe hypothesis that this
man was poisoned between the hours of two thirty
and three thirty yesterday (Tuesday) morning.”</p>

<p>Evelyn shivered. “It would seem so,” she admitted.
“Yet where was the body all that time?”</p>

<p>“And where the murderer?” Maynard’s light tone
struck a jarring note and for once Evelyn ignored
him, as she waited for the detective’s answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>“Is that Mr. Burnham speaking?” questioned
Mitchell, rising hurriedly as voices reached them
from the hall. Evelyn was saved reply by Burnham
walking into the room. He was followed by
Coroner Penfield and James Palmer.</p>

<p>“Here are the men you want, Penfield,” he exclaimed
on catching sight of Hayden and Maynard.
“Come and tell us about the inquest.”</p>

<p>Penfield, directly addressed, bowed gravely to
Evelyn, who had risen with the others on their entrance,
and then regarded his host with no lenient
eye. That Burnham had been drinking or was
under some powerful drug was evident, and Penfield
wished heartily that Evelyn would retire; he
disliked scenes—dead people were one thing, hysterical
women another.</p>

<p>“There has been no inquest yet,” he said. “We
are waiting for the principals in the case to be in
condition to attend it before we hold it.”</p>

<p>“Principals?” Burnham moved nearer and placed
an unsteady hand on the back of a chair. “Who
d’ye mean?”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Ward, primarily,” responded Penfield politely.
“I understand, Hayden, she is ill from
shock.”</p>

<p>“Yes, she is; nothing very serious, however.”</p>

<p>“Has she a nurse?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Mrs. Duvall.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>“Excellent,” Penfield rubbed his hands together.
“I would like to talk to Nurse Duvall if convenient.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, Penfield,” Hayden made a motion to
go but Evelyn was before him.</p>

<p>“I’ll run up and take her place with Mrs. Ward
so she can come down to see you,” she volunteered
and slipped from the room.</p>

<p>Burnham, who had been brooding over the coroner’s
remarks, stopped his restless walk about the
room, and thereby collided with James Palmer,
whose bulky form dwarfed Mrs. Burnham’s Empire
furniture.</p>

<p>“Why’d you tell me in the hall that you held an
inquest and then deny it in here?” he asked. “Was
it because Evelyn was present?”</p>

<p>“No, Mr. Burnham; you have things mixed,”
protested Penfield. “I never mentioned an inquest,
but said we had held an autopsy.”</p>

<p>“Ah, and with what results?” asked Hayden.
“Or is it not permissible to tell now?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; it will be in the morning papers, so I
am breaking no confidence,” Penfield moved nearer
the five men who had grouped themselves about
the grand piano. “On submitting the gastric contents
to tests we found the presence of a solution
of hydrocyanic acid.”</p>

<p>Maynard broke the ensuing silence. “Hydrocyanic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
acid,” he repeated. “Isn’t that a form of
prussic acid?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and in a diluted form sometimes given for
stomach disorders,” responded Penfield. At his
answer Burnham sat down suddenly as if stricken.
His action was only observed by Hayden and
Palmer, Penfield’s attention being focused upon
Maynard who stood gazing at him across the piano
with expressionless face.</p>

<p>“Prussic acid,” he murmured. “Ah, Penfield,
that bears out my theory.”</p>

<p>“And what is your theory?” demanded Mitchell
quickly, bending forward.</p>

<p>“That the man committed suicide.” Seeing the
incredulity with which his statement was received,
Maynard added: “Had the man been murdered he
would instantly have detected the presence of prussic
acid—there is no disguising the taste of bitter
almonds.”</p>

<p>“Yes, there is,” retorted Coroner Penfield.
“The dose in this instance was administered in a
cordial which in itself contains the same bitter
flavor—cherry brandy.”</p>

<small>THE “ACE”</small></h2>

<p class="drop-cap">MARIAN VAN NESS detached herself
from the stream of people moving slowly
up Seventeenth Street and raced to the
opposite curb, only arriving in time, however, to
see the Mt. Pleasant car sail serenely by. A second,
third, and fourth car, their passengers clinging
like ants to steps and even fenders, rounded the
curve without stopping and continued up Connecticut
Avenue. In despair Marian turned about and
tucking the papers she carried more securely under
her arm, set out for the Burnham house. She had
walked but a third of the way when a man fell
into step with her and looking around she found
René La Montagne by her side.</p>

<p>“Ah! Captain, good afternoon,” she exclaimed.
“Did you receive my telephone message?”</p>

<p>“But yes, madame, and I hurried most quickly
to the State Department only to find you gone.”
The French officer reached over and took her small
bundle of papers. “Permit that I carry them,” he
said with a quick courtly bow, and taking possession<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
of the papers he slipped them inside the pocket
of his blue tunic. “Tell me, madame, you have
seen Evelyn,” and Marian read in his eyes the
passion even Evelyn’s name kindled in the gallant
officer and her heart throbbed with the quick and
ready sympathy every woman feels for true
romance.</p>

<p>“Yes. I am on my way to join Evelyn now,” she
answered. “Frankly, Captain, what has estranged
you two?”</p>

<p>La Montagne’s expression grew troubled. “It is
not of my making,” he protested. “My letters remain
unanswered——”</p>

<p>“Are you quite certain, Captain, that Evelyn received
your letters?”</p>

<p>“But yes,” and as she would have spoken he
added rapidly: “When I cabled that I would arrive
shortly in this country, having been detailed here
to instruct in the aviation, and received no reply I
questioned in my mind if Evelyn had received it.
Getting leave, I went to Chelsea and called upon
Mr. and Mrs. Burnham——”</p>

<p>“You did!”</p>

<p>“Of course, madame.” La Montagne emphasized
his remarks with gesticulations eminently characteristic
of his race. “It was my misfortune that Evelyn
was away, and through some inadvertence my
cable had not been forwarded to her. I had but a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
few hours in Chelsea, but upon my return to duty
I wrote to Evelyn a letter requiring a reply, and I
sent it by what you call ‘registered’ post.”</p>

<p>“And she answered the letter?”</p>

<p>“No.” In spite of his effort to keep his tone expressionless
the monosyllable betrayed emotion.</p>

<p>“Then you can take it that Evelyn never received
your letter,” exclaimed Marian vehemently.</p>

<p>“You think not!” La Montagne’s face lighted,
then fell. “But how is that within the possible?
The return card bore her signature of receipt.”</p>

<p>Marian stopped and stared at the Frenchman.
“Her signature? Are you quite sure?”</p>

<p>“Oui, madame. I have read her few letters too
often to be mistaken,” retorted La Montagne. “She
signed the receipt.”</p>

<p>Marian resumed her walk up the street, a puzzled
frown creasing her forehead. “Where did you
send the letter?” she asked.</p>

<p>“To Burnham Lodge, Chelsea, New Jersey.”</p>

<p>Marian quickened her pace to avoid being run
down by a speeding automobile as they crossed
Massachusetts Avenue.</p>

<p>“And where was the return receipt card from?”
she inquired, a trifle breathless from her exertions.</p>

<p>“From the same place.” La Montagne fumbled
in an inside pocket. “But view,” he said, holding
up a much battered return registered mail card.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
Marian took the card and studied the postmark, its
date, and Evelyn’s clear and distinct signature in
puzzled silence, then handed back the card.</p>

<p>“I can only tell you,” she stated slowly, “that
Evelyn spent the entire summer in a convent out
West; she has not been at Burnham Lodge for a
year.”</p>

<p>The Frenchman stared at her. “What is it you
say?” he exclaimed in deep astonishment, and
Marian repeated her statement. “But it is not possible!”
he ejaculated. “Not possible!”</p>

<p>“Yes it is,” Marian’s face expressed indomitable
determination. “And I can’t have Evelyn’s happiness
jeopardized by——” She stopped to wave her
hand to Dr. Hayden, Dan Maynard, and James
Palmer, who whirled by in an automobile. La Montagne,
who had raised his hand in salute as the
other men lifted their hats, whirled back to Marian,
his face alight.</p>

<p>“Evelyn has not lost her affection; she is still
true,” he began incoherently. “Ah, you have
brought me news the most good—let us hurry to
Evelyn.”</p>

<p>“Wait just a moment,” and Marian laid a detaining
hand on the impetuous Frenchman’s arm.
“We must sift this out a bit first. How were you
received at Burnham Lodge and by whom?”</p>

<p>“Most cordially by both Mr. and Mrs. Burnham.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>“Was that the first time you had met them?”</p>

<p>“No, oh, no; we have met before in Paris, and
I saw Mrs. Burnham when in New York visiting
my American cousins. It was in my cousin’s house
that I met Evelyn.”</p>

<p>“So Evelyn told me.” Marian did not think it
necessary to add that Evelyn had awakened her
from her brief nap after her all night vigil in Mrs.
Ward’s room, and poured out her story of love,
misunderstanding and lost letters with such pathos
that Marian had promptly championed her cause
with every impulse of her loyal nature. Having
met Captain La Montagne earlier in the summer she
had then and there vowed to see him before the
twenty-four hours were over, and if, as she had
begun to suspect, she found that peculiar methods
were being used to estrange the lovers, she decided
to try and aid them.</p>

<p>“Captain,” she commenced, “did you see much
of Mr. Burnham when he was in Paris?”</p>

<p>“No.” The Frenchman tempered the brief answer
with an explanation. “Mr. Burnham is some years
older and we are not what you might call”—he
paused, searching for a word—“in sympathy.”</p>

<p>“I see.” Marian stared thoughtfully at a passing
touring car. “It must have been fully five years
ago, but was there not some story about Mr. Burnham
when he was in Paris?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>There was a pause, and when he spoke, the
Frenchman confined himself to the word: “Yes.”</p>

<p>Marian’s eyes lighted. “My memory sometimes
plays me tricks,” she said. “What were the details?”</p>

<p>La Montagne did not answer at once. “It was not
so much,” he began. “Count André de Sartiges
and Mr. Burnham had a dispute at Longchamps,
and the next afternoon André slapped Mr. Burnham’s
face in the club.”</p>

<p>“And what happened then?” persisted Marian as
he stopped.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” La Montagne shrugged his shoulders.
“In France it meant a duel; but as Mr. Burnham
was an American who did not believe in dueling, the
affair was soon forgotten.”</p>

<p>“All the same Mr. Burnham had to leave Paris,”
retorted Marian, “and Mr. Burnham is a man
who harbors grievances. I fear, Captain, that he
does not favor your engagement to Evelyn.”</p>

<p>La Montagne transferred his regard from Marian
to a colored passer-by and the woman happening
to catch his eye, started back, alarmed. After he
and Marian passed, the woman turned and regarded
their backs before continuing on her way.</p>

<p>“I ’spect he looked dat away when he seed a
Hun,” she ejaculated. “An’ from de medals he’s
awearin’, he musta seen a pile ob Huns, but why<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
fo’ he look at a respectable colored lady like he
wanter murder her.”</p>

<p>Totally unaware of the sentiments he had
aroused, la Montagne strolled by Marian’s side
for some moments in silence.</p>

<p>“Madame Burnham has given me letters of introduction
to friends and her husband has invited me
to their house,” he said at last. “To question Mr.
Burnham’s friendship——”</p>

<p>“Is wise,” supplemented Marian softly. The
Frenchman remained silent and she added with
vehemence: “Because when Mr. Burnham’s animosity
is suppressed it is all the more dangerous. Take
a friendly tip from me; do not trust him, and
remember, he has great influence over his wife.”</p>

<p>“If Evelyn will but marry me, we need not heed
Burnham,” exclaimed La Montagne.</p>

<p>“And what have you to live on if you married
without Mrs. Burnham’s consent?” asked Marian
dryly. “Ah! forgive me,” as La Montagne colored
hotly under his tan. “By the terms of her father’s
will Evelyn can only inherit her fortune by marrying
to suit her mother. If Mrs. Burnham disapproves,
the fortune goes to her instead of to
Evelyn.”</p>

<p>“Wills! Bah!” La Montagne’s gestures were
expressive. “I adore Evelyn, not her money. If
<i>Le Bon Dieu</i> be so good as to spare me through this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
war Evelyn will not be badly off, as I will eventually
inherit my uncle’s estate.” He turned eloquent,
appealing eyes to Marian. “Ah, madame, use your
kind offices that I may see Evelyn now.”</p>

<p>“Not now, to-morrow.” Marian tempered her refusal
with a warm bright smile. “Call it what you
will. Captain—a sixth sense, or woman’s intuition—but
do not trust Peter Burnham.” She stopped
and held out her hand. “I will not let you come
further,” she stated positively as he started to
remonstrate. “I will telephone you and anything
sent in my care will always reach Evelyn. Good
by,” and not waiting to hear his hearty thanks she
turned down the street and ran up the Burnhams’
steps.</p>

<p>Jones opened the front door for her with gusto.</p>

<p>“Miss Evelyn’s gone to her room,” he confided
to her. “And the master’s out. Shall I bring a
cup of tea to your room, Mrs. Van Ness?”</p>

<p>“No, thanks, Jones, it is too near dinner time,”
and Marian, not glancing inside the drawing room
door as she passed down the hall, mounted the
staircase to the second floor. She went at once to
Evelyn’s room, and to her disappointment found
it empty. Pausing undecidedly at the door, she
finally crossed the hall to her bedroom and, taking
off her hat, wasted no time in dressing for dinner.</p>

<p>It was still lacking fifteen minutes to the dinner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
hour when she returned to Evelyn’s bedroom; its
occupant was still absent, and Marian hesitated
whether to go downstairs or into the library.
Finally deciding in favor of the latter course she
walked down the hall, and parting the portières,
stepped into the room. A man bending over an
open drawer of the desk straightened up at her
approach and she recognized Dan Maynard.</p>

<p>“Good evening,” he exclaimed, and the cordial
ring in his voice found its accompaniment in the
quick lighting of his eyes as he looked at her.
“Don’t go,” as murmuring a polite greeting, she
started to leave.</p>

<p>“Am I not disturbing your occupation?” she
asked.</p>

<p>Maynard laughed softly. “My occupation consists
at the moment in searching for writing paper,”
he acknowledged, pushing back a lot of loose papers
and some string in the drawer. “Do take this
chair,” and he wheeled one forward.</p>

<p>Marian settled down in the depths of the big
chair with a sigh of content; she had had no rest
the night before, the work at the State Department
had been exacting, and while the walk home had
for the moment refreshed her, she was more weary
than she at first realized.</p>

<p>“I thought I saw you motoring with Dr. Hayden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
and Jim Palmer,” she remarked, after waiting for
Maynard to break the silence.</p>

<p>“He gave me a lift as far as the Connecticut
Avenue telegraph office.” Maynard looked down at
his business suit and then at her becoming evening
dress. “I must apologize for not dressing for
dinner,” he said. “The fact is I left England so
hurriedly that my luggage is still in London. The
clerk in the shipping office, when I went to inquire
when the next Cunarder would sail, whispered in
my ear that she was leaving that afternoon and I
had just time to make the boat but could not go
back to collect my belongings.”</p>

<p>“Was your trip across uneventful?” she questioned,
noting with inward approval his tall, well-knit
form and broad shoulders.</p>

<p>“Yes, except for the search at Quarantine; some
report had gotten about that there were suspects
aboard and we met with a lot of espionage and
were severely cross-examined,” he stepped back
to the desk and closed the drawer. “I am glad
you like René La Montagne,” he said, and she
started at the irrelevant remark. “He’s an ‘ace,’
you know, in the French Flying Corps.”</p>

<p>“Yes.” She looked at him, slightly puzzled.
“How do you know I like Captain La Montagne?”</p>

<p>“Because you were walking with him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>She laughed amusedly. “Is my walking with
people a sign that I like them?”</p>

<p>“So I have heard—commented,” he said, and his
eyes held hers. “I would very much like to do
some sight-seeing; will you not take pity and show
me Washington?”</p>

<p>Marian’s fingers were playing with the string
of coral which she wore about her neck. “It would
be the blind leading the blind,” she said, and her
voice sounded strained even to her own ears.
“Washington is changed in the last few months.
Mr. Burnham would prove a better guide than I.”</p>

<p>“Speaking about me?” inquired their host from
the doorway of his room and Marian started; she
had not heard the door opened. “Why are you two
sitting up here?” he demanded querulously, and
Maynard, glancing in his direction, noted that
Burnham made a detour of the room which prevented
his near approach to the chair where the
dead man had been found. “The drawing room is
much pleasanter,” he remarked, stopping half way
across the room. “Suppose we go there.”</p>

<p>Before Marian could rise, the portières were
pushed aside and Detective Mitchell stepped inside
the library. He looked with quick displeasure from
one to the other.</p>

<p>“You were directed, sir,” he said, addressing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
Burnham, “by the Chief of Police not to use this
room until further notice.”</p>

<p>“Tut, tut!” Burnham reddened angrily. “I
don’t take instructions in my own house, and I
won’t permit my guests to be dictated to. You
can go, Mitchell.”</p>

<p>Instead of complying with his dictatorial order
the detective stood his ground. Burnham, his face
almost apoplectic in color, advanced threateningly
and except for Maynard’s hasty step forward his
raised fist would have struck Mitchell.</p>

<p>“Keep cool, Burnham,” he advised, and his voice
brought the angry man to his senses. “Mitchell,
there is no occasion for this excitement; Mrs. Van
Ness and I were sitting here chatting and Mr.
Burnham had just joined us. We have moved
nothing in this room.”</p>

<p>Mitchell glanced searchingly about; apparently
Maynard’s statement was correct; every piece of
furniture, even the chess table, apparently stood in
its accustomed place. He glanced apologetically at
Marian, who had risen and stood with one hand on
the back of her chair.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” he admitted. “But as a precautionary
measure the room will have to be
sealed.”</p>

<p>Maynard, by an imperative gesture, stopped another
explosion from Burnham. “What authority<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
have you, Mitchell, for taking such a step?” he
inquired.</p>

<p>“The coroner’s orders,” gruffly. “I’ll get him,”
and Mitchell disappeared.</p>

<p>Burnham pounded the nearest table in his wrath.
“Do you think I am going to take orders in my own
house?” he demanded of Maynard. “Do you?”
and his hand continued to punctuate the question.</p>

<p>“Take care, you’ll injure your chess table,” cautioned
Maynard. “There is no use in bucking up
against the police, Burnham; they are within their
rights in asking to have this room set aside for
further investigation. It was thoughtless of me to
come in.”</p>

<p>“I think we had all better leave,” suggested
Marian, who had listened to the argument between
Burnham and the detective with a strained attention
which had not escaped Maynard’s notice. “I
stopped in here expecting to find Evelyn.”</p>

<p>“She is with Mrs. Ward,” grumbled Burnham—his
temper was still ruffled. “Hello, what’s that
commotion?” as the sound of raised voices reached
them. “The police again—I’ll tell Mitchell what I
think of him, the interfering idiot!” And taking
a hasty step forward he swung his arm upward and
back.</p>

<p>But it was not the detective who stepped across<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
the threshold and ran full tilt against Burnham’s
outstretched, threatening fist.</p>

<p>“Good gracious, Peter, what are you doing?”
demanded his wife, dropping her pet dog to tenderly
feel her nose. “Are you mad!” as, ignoring the
presence of Marian and Maynard, he embraced
her with effusion.</p>

<p>“No,” he retorted. “But I think people will soon
make me mad. I sent you a telegram, Lillian, not
to return. Didn’t you get it?”</p>

<p>“I got it—also the morning newspapers,” dryly.
“You might have telegraphed with as much effect
to Mont Blanc not to freeze as to wire me not to
come home after I read what took place here
yesterday. So you are really here, Dan,” shaking
hands cordially with the actor before greeting
Marian whom she kissed warmly, then she subsided
into the nearest chair, and addressed her husband.
“Now, Peter, what is it all about?”</p>

<p>Burnham looked vexedly at his wife; there were
times when her brusque manner tried his patience,
but experience had taught him that she pursued one
idea with bulldog tenacity, and if she had made up
her mind to hear full particulars of the mysterious
tragedy which had brought her hurrying back to
Washington, she would sit in that chair until she
had the information she desired. Burnham was
saved replying to her question by the return of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
Mitchell and Coroner Penfield, and he welcomed
the latter with relief.</p>

<p>“My wife, Coroner Penfield,” he said by way of
introduction, “and Mrs. Van Ness; Mr. Maynard
you have already met.”</p>

<p>Penfield bowed to all in turn.</p>

<p>“I am sorry, Mr. Burnham,” he began, finding
attention centered upon him, “but I really think it
is necessary to close this room for a few days.”</p>

<p>“Why?” demanded Mrs. Burnham, and Penfield
eyed her uneasily; he had heard much of her, of
her social position, her philanthropy, her eccentricities,
and her caustic wit. In spite of her disheveled
and dusty traveling costume her air of
breeding and quiet hauteur showed the characteristics
which had gained her leadership among
Washington’s most exclusive society.</p>

<p>“Sudden death has to be investigated, madam,”
explained Penfield, not relishing the persistent gaze
of her penetrating cold blue eyes. “It is unfortunate
that your library should have been the scene
of this man’s death.”</p>

<p>“It is very unfortunate,” agreed Mrs. Burnham,
as Penfield paused, finding himself getting somewhat
involved in his statement. “Have you and
the police discovered the name of the individual
who had the temerity to commit suicide in my
house?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>“He did not commit suicide.” Penfield was losing
patience and the faint smile on Maynard’s face
nettled him. “The man was murdered.”</p>

<p>“Murdered!” Except for the exclamation Mrs.
Burnham sat bolt upright silently regarding Penfield
who bore her fixed stare as long as he could
and then changed his position.</p>

<p>“We haven’t been able to identify the man so
far,” he went on to say. “We have searched
the Rogues’ Gallery, photographers’ studios, telegraphed
his description to other cities, and no clue.”</p>

<p>“And no clue?” Mrs. Burnham’s repetition of
the words was parrot-like in its mimicry. “Did the
dead man have no papers in his pocket? Were his
clothes unmarked?”</p>

<p>“They were,” replied Penfield. “The only article
to be found in the man’s pockets was a string.” He
turned abruptly to Maynard. “You recall seeing
the string?”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>Penfield looked relieved. “I am glad you do,”
he exclaimed. “This case puzzles me, and I have
given it so much thought that I concluded I had
imagined the string.”</p>

<p>Burnham, who had seated himself near his wife,
looked up.</p>

<p>“Have you the string?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No,” glumly. “I recollect twirling it about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
my fingers just before Mrs. Ward fell unconscious
to the floor. After we carried her to her room
I searched for the string but could not find it,”
finished Penfield.</p>

<p>The parting of the portières disturbed Mrs.
Burnham and looking up she beheld Jones, his eyes
twice their usual size, regarding her from the
doorway.</p>

<p>“Dinner is served, madam,” he announced.</p>

<small>DEVELOPMENTS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SCURRYING footsteps caused Peter Burnham
to stop unwrapping the bundle in his hand
and dart to the door of his bedroom. From
that vantage point he saw Evelyn cross the hall
and disappear down the staircase. He took quick
note of her well cut sport suit and the lovely bouquet
of orchids pinned thereon. Evelyn, busily
engaged in adjusting a stray curl under her smart
tri-cornered hat, failed to observe her step-father
standing well back in the shadow of his doorway.
Burnham waited in indecision until the slam of the
front door reached him, then going back to his
bureau he closed its drawers and went swiftly to
his wife’s boudoir.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burnham looked up at his approach and
dropped her knitting in her lap.</p>

<p>“Don’t close the door, Peter,” she remonstrated.
“It is very warm in here and the room is stuffy.”</p>

<p>“Then why not open this second window?” asked
Burnham. Not waiting for an answer to his question,
he threw up the sash and in the sudden current<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
of air admitted by the opening of the window, the
papers on his wife’s desk blew about the room.</p>

<p>“There, Peter, see what you have done.” Mrs.
Burnham’s vexation was betrayed by her heightened
color. “And I have just tidied my desk. Be sure
and put every letter back exactly where it was.”</p>

<p>It took Burnham some minutes to comply with
her request, and she observed with silent, but growing
irritation, that her correspondence was not being
piled in neat little packages such as she had arranged
with minute attention to detail earlier that
morning.</p>

<p>“Don’t trouble to put the bills uppermost,” she
said, her eyes twinkling. “That will do nicely,
Peter; come and sit down, you look warm,” and
her pointed knitting needle indicated the vacant
arm chair, the mate to the one she was occupying,
which, with her chair and a table, about filled the
octagon-shaped wing of her boudoir.</p>

<p>Burnham sat down with a short, discontented
sigh. “I can’t conceive why we closed the Lodge
and came in town so early,” he grumbled, dabbing
his forehead with a handkerchief. “Washington
is unbearable.”</p>

<p>“The nights are not so bad, and if you would
keep cool, Peter, you would not feel the heat so
much.” Mrs. Burnham took up her knitting. “If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
I remember correctly it was you who first suggested
our returning this month.”</p>

<p>Burnham moved restlessly and pursed up his
lips. “Well, what could we do with Evelyn taking
the bit in her teeth?” he demanded. “You cannot
detain a girl in a convent by force, and she could
not remain in this city unchaperoned.”</p>

<p>“True.” Mrs. Burnham contented herself with
the single word and knitted on in silence.</p>

<p>“It is a great pity, Lillian,” complained Burnham,
growing restive under the short quick glances with
which his wife favored him, “that your discipline
was so lax; in consequence, Evelyn has grown up
with the idea that her wish is law.”</p>

<p>“She comes of a headstrong race,” acknowledged
Mrs. Burnham, with a half sigh. “Do not
worry, Peter, Evelyn will consider herself madly
in love a dozen times before she actually finds the
man she will marry.”</p>

<p>Burnham leaned back in his chair and thrust
his hands in his pockets. “René La Montagne is
still in town,” he announced.</p>

<p>“Not really?” Mrs. Burnham laid aside her
knitting. “I understood he had been detailed to
one of the aviation training camps in the South.”</p>

<p>“He hasn’t gone yet for Maynard told me that
he saw him at the Shoreham Tuesday night.” Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
Burnham made no comment and her husband added
with suppressed vehemence, “Tough luck!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burnham drummed her knitting needles up
and down on the arm of her chair in troubled
silence.</p>

<p>“I disapprove of international marriages,” she
said finally. “I have seen too many unhappy results;
take, for instance, Marian Van Ness——” Her
needles clicked loudly in the still room, and there
was a decided pause before she added: “I don’t
really know the rights of the case as Marian was
married in Europe and passed her brief matrimonial
career away from Washington, but,” again
Mrs. Burnham paused, “but I agree with the diplomat
who said: ‘Those whom the Atlantic has put
asunder, let no man join together.’”</p>

<p>“You will have a difficult task convincing Evelyn
of your viewpoint,” retorted Burnham. “If I don’t
mistake the signs you may face an elopement, if,
as I strongly suspect, Evelyn and René are carrying
on a clandestine correspondence.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burnham stooped to retrieve her ball of
yarn which had rolled to the floor before she asked:
“Where did you get that idea?”</p>

<p>“From Jones, whose mysterious manner when I
met him carrying a box of flowers to Evelyn and
delivering a note surreptitiously made me suspicious.
I promptly told him to report to you hereafter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
whenever letters and packages were given him
for Evelyn.”</p>

<p>“Quite right.” Mrs. Burnham spoke with decision.
“We want no elopements; but upon my
word, Peter, I could not help but like René La
Montagne. If it were not for the fact that he is a
foreigner and that he is personally objectionable to
you——” She hesitated and cast a penetrating look
at her husband who sat staring moodily at the floor.
“He is still objectionable to you?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, but why go into that?” he answered
sharply, then yawned. “Upon my word, Lillian,
I have had very little sleep lately; I believe I’ll go
and take a nap.” As he spoke he rose and stretched
himself, then took several indolent steps toward
the door, but his wife’s next remark halted him
on its threshold.</p>

<p>“Any news from Coroner Penfield?”</p>

<p>“Not a word.” Burnham rubbed his chin reflectively.
“The police, according to the morning
newspapers, have failed to discover the man’s
identity.”</p>

<p>“Strange!” mused Mrs. Burnham. “And haven’t
they ascertained why he was killed in this house?”</p>

<p>Burnham shifted his weight first on one foot
and then on the other, his hands clenched inside
his coat pockets.</p>

<p>“My dear Lillian, you cannot establish a motive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
for the crime—if crime it was,” he interpolated,
“until you establish the man’s identity. See you
later,” and smiling affectionately at her he turned
and left the room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burnham knitted on and the khaki sweater
gained in size as her industrious fingers plied the
needles. Finally she laid the half completed garment
in her lap and looked about the boudoir. It
was a pleasant room, light and airy, and its home-like
atmosphere was borne out in its furniture still
covered with summer chintz. The oddly shaped
octagon wing added to its size and general appearance.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burnham stared thoughtfully down into
the garden which the octagon windows overlooked,
then turned her head and glanced through the side
window diagonally across into Evelyn’s bedroom.
From where she sat she viewed with displeasure
the clothes thrown in a disorderly heap on Evelyn’s
bed and started to call through the opened windows
to the chambermaid whom she glimpsed in
another part of the room, not to put away the
clothes but to leave that task to Evelyn. Even as
she made up her mind, the maid whisked out of
the bedroom and Mrs. Burnham turned her attention
to the room in which she was sitting.</p>

<p>Laying her knitting on the table she listened a
moment. Only the twitter of birds and the distant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
hum of a motor disturbed the peaceful autumn
stillness. Releasing her hold on the sweater, Mrs.
Burnham picked up her large knitting bag and
when she removed her hand from its capacious
interior her fingers grasped a pair of shell spectacles
and a book. Laying the latter in her lap she
adjusted the spectacles on her nose, then she raised
the book and scanned its title: “Taylor’s Medical
Jurisprudence and Toxicology.” She turned the
leaves rapidly until she came to the heading “Detection
of Poisons” and her eyes ran down the
pages picking out the paragraphs opposite which
she discerned faint pencil marks. When she again
returned the book to its place in her knitting bag
an hour had passed.</p>

<p>Blissfully unconscious that she had formed the
chief topic of conversation between her step-father
and mother, Evelyn Preston, on leaving the house,
hurried to Dupont Circle and seeing a disengaged
taxi waiting at the cab-stand she entered the
machine and directed the chauffeur to take her to
Potomac Park.</p>

<p>As the taxi-cab threaded its way among the
vehicles filling Seventeenth Street below Pennsylvania
Avenue, Evelyn gazed in wonder at the congested
sidewalks. It was the noon hour and clerks
from the immense Government buildings in the
vicinity were hurrying to lunch rooms and cafeterias<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
which had sprung up like mushrooms to meet the demands
of hungry humanity. Evelyn mentally contrasted
the scene with that in the same locality six
months before and shook her head in bewilderment;
the once peaceful old-time residence district had
been electrified into life by the iron hand of war.</p>

<p>The taxi-cab, narrowly missing an on-coming
touring car which zig-zagged unpleasantly in its
effort to make the turn into Seventeenth Street,
swung into Potomac Drive and, following Evelyn’s
directions, the chauffeur drove his car to the Aviation
Field which had been formerly the polo
grounds of the National Capital. The taxi-cab’s
approach had been observed from the hangar, and
one of the officers standing near the building
crossed the turf and was at the roadside when the
car drew up.</p>

<p>As Evelyn looked down into La Montagne’s
happy upturned face all the doubts which had
been tormenting her vanished. Without speaking
he jerked open the cab door and seated himself
by her side.</p>

<p>“My heart’s dearest,” he murmured in rapid
French. “At last!” and his hands clasped hers
and stooping he kissed her in the shelter of the
closed cab. “Mrs. Van Ness explained——” he
began a moment later.</p>

<p>“Indeed she did, bless her!” ejaculated Evelyn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
happily, in his native tongue which she spoke with
barely an accent, and she touched her orchids with
tender fingers. “These flowers came through her
agency, as well as your dear note, René.”</p>

<p>“I followed her advice.” La Montagne’s face
darkened. “But I like not to court you in secret,
dear heart; surely your mother is one to see reason.
I am not,” flushing, “objectionable; nor am I
altogether without money.”</p>

<p>“I do not think it was mother who suppressed
your letters,” exclaimed Evelyn. “I suspect my
step-father——”</p>

<p>An exclamation interrupted her. “I cannot understand
a nature so complex,” declared La Montagne.
“Mr. Burnham on the surface, perhaps, is the
most gracious host——” He paused abruptly. “But
do not let us waste the precious hour talking of
him; what of yourself?” and he scanned her with
adoring eyes.</p>

<p>“I am very well and—” with a shy upward look—“happy,
now that your silence is explained.” Her
eyes filled with tears. “Ah, René, I was cruelly
hurt by your apparent neglect.”</p>

<p>“Never think that of me again,” exclaimed La
Montagne, deep feeling in voice and gesture. “You
are my ideal, my love. I will marry you with or
without your mother’s consent.”</p>

<p>Evelyn shook her head in dissent as she pressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
his hand. “We will marry, but it will be with
mother’s approval,” she said. “Mr. Burnham is
clever, but he cannot hoodwink mother all the time;
and”—she nodded wisely—“I have a score to settle
for what he made me suffer this summer.”</p>

<p>“Were you ill-treated, heart’s dearest?” demanded
La Montagne.</p>

<p>“Oh, no. I chose the convent after a dispute
with Mr. Burnham who insisted that I accept Mary
Palmer’s invitation to spend the summer with her
in the Adirondacks.” She hesitated, then in a sudden
burst of confidence, added a trifle incoherently:
“I didn’t care to accept because, you see, Mary’s
brother, Jim Palmer, has—well, he—that is, he likes
me.”</p>

<p>“I can well believe it,” acknowledged La Montagne
and they laughed light-heartedly, but a shadow
lurked in his handsome eyes as he glanced at
her fresh young beauty. “And this Monsieur Jim,
does he make love?”</p>

<p>“Well, he tries to,” admitted Evelyn, and a faint
roguish dimple appeared in her cheek as a sudden
recollection of a scene with Jim Palmer at the
Chevy Chase Club brought a covert smile to her
lips. “Mr. Palmer is my step-father’s most
intimate friend, and so——”</p>

<p>“He favors the match; ah, I begin to see.” La
Montagne straightened his slender figure to military<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
erectness. “There is a motive then for Mr. Burnham’s
animosity other than that suggested by our
good friend, Madame Van Ness. But tell me,
Evelyn,” and his tender voice caressed her name,
“what is this I read in the newspapers of a dead
man in your house?”</p>

<p>“I know no more about it than what you saw
in the papers.” Evelyn’s blue eyes clouded. “It
was a great shock to find him sitting there in the
library—dead. Apparently the police are at as
great a loss about the whole affair as I am.”</p>

<p>“I saw they had not decided the man’s identity.”
The Frenchman paused and glanced doubtfully at
Evelyn; he had been quick to observe her loss of
color at mention of the tragedy and concluded with
the intuitive sympathy of his nature that the subject
distressed her, and the words which he had
intended to say remained unspoken. “Let us discuss
no more such gloomy matters. Will you not
lunch with me at the Willard?”</p>

<p>Evelyn considered the invitation before she answered.
“I wish I could accept,” she said, and
her disappointment was evident. “But there is no
use needlessly antagonizing mother. She is a great
stickler for the conventions, and I know she would
not permit me to lunch with you unchaperoned.”</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">He took out Marian’s package of papers and placed them in
Evelyn’s lap.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“But where can we meet?” demanded La Montagne;
a glance at the hangar had shown him an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
orderly advancing toward the car and he rightly
divined that his presence was required by a brother
officer. “Heart’s dearest, do not let it be long before
I see you again.”</p>

<p>“I am dining to-night with Marian, why not
come to her apartment this evening?”</p>

<p>“Excellent!” La Montagne nodded to the orderly
who stood at salute beside the car. “I will be with
the colonel at once,” he said addressing him and as
the soldier moved away, he turned again to Evelyn
and kissed her hand passionately before he sprang
from the car. “Ah, I just remember—you will see
Mrs. Van Ness before I do, therefore will you
hand her these papers which I was so forgetful as
to carry away in my pocket when I left her yesterday?”
As he spoke he took out Marian’s package of
papers and placed them in Evelyn’s lap.</p>

<p>Evelyn’s chauffeur, finding that she and La Montagne
were too absorbed in each other to pay attention
to him, had wandered over to the hangar,
keeping a watchful eye on his car. He had overheard
the dispatch of the orderly for La Montagne,
and had promptly hurried back to the car, reaching
it just as the Frenchman strode away.</p>

<p>“Where to, Miss?” he asked. Evelyn, absorbed
in watching La Montagne, actually jumped as his
harsh voice recalled her attention. She gazed at
him blankly for a moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>“To Woodward and Lothrop’s,” she directed, and
added as he prepared to slip into the driver’s seat,
“Haven’t I seen you before?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss.” He half turned, his freckles and
red hair showing distinctly in the glare of the sunlight.
“I took you home from the Union Station
on Tuesday morning.”</p>

<p>“Oh, surely, I remember now,” and Evelyn settled
back in the car.</p>

<p>She was some time in doing her numerous
errands and it was two hours before the taxi-cab
swung into her street and stopped with such abruptness
in front of her door that her many packages
which partly filled the seat by her side were deposited
on the floor of the car. With the aid of
the apologetic chauffeur she was engaged in picking
them up when a voice behind her caused her to
turn around.</p>

<p>“Let me help,” exclaimed Dan Maynard, and
reaching past her he retrieved a skein of worsted
which eluded her grasp. “Your mother was quite
worried when you didn’t return for luncheon. In
fact,” and his charming smile was contagious, “I
believe I stopped her from sending the town crier
after you.”</p>

<p>“And who is he?” asked Evelyn laughing.</p>

<p>“Burnham, perhaps.” Maynard laughed also.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
“Let me pay the man, your hands are full,” as she
fumbled for her purse.</p>

<p>“No, no,” she protested, but Maynard, paying
no attention, turned back to question the chauffeur
and before Evelyn could reach them Maynard
handed the man a bank note.</p>

<p>“We can settle it later, Evelyn,” he said. “Now,
don’t let us squabble over a trifle.”</p>

<p>“A trifle!” Evelyn laughed gayly. “I don’t call
a three hour taxi bill a trifle; however, we’ll let
Mother arbitrate the dispute. What is it?” as the
chauffeur ran up to her.</p>

<p>“Another package, Miss,” and touching his hat
he placed the bundle of papers on top of the
packages she carried and retired.</p>

<p>“Take care, you will drop them,” cautioned Maynard,
putting a steadying hand on the packages.
He had just succeeded in readjusting their balance
when his sleeve button caught in a string, and as
he drew back his hand several papers from the
package entrusted to her care by La Montagne
fluttered to the ground.</p>

<p>“Very awkward of me,” exclaimed Maynard,
annoyed by his carelessness, and he stooped to pick
up the papers and returned them to Evelyn. Then
his hand sought the door bell and Evelyn, her
eyes following his motion, saw the string still
dangling from his sleeve button. The string, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
woven red and green strands, stood out in bold
relief against the white woodwork of the doorway.</p>

<p>Where had she seen such a string before? Slowly
Evelyn’s thoughts returned to the scene in the
library on Tuesday afternoon, and again she saw
a similar string removed from the dead man’s
pocket and twirled about in the coroner’s fingers.</p>

<p>Maynard’s glance had followed hers; his finger
pressed the button of the door bell hard, then was
removed as he held up his hand.</p>

<p>“From which bundle did I pull off this string?”
he asked.</p>

<p>Evelyn looked at the packages in her hand in
uncertainty; Marian’s bundle of papers was untied,
a box of candy, and some stationery were also
minus their strings due to the careless handling
they had received while she carried them about
with her on her shopping tour.</p>

<p>“I really don’t know,” she replied. “Oh, Jones,”
as that worthy opened the front door. “Do get
me something to eat, I am famished.”</p>

<p>She turned back inside the hall to address Maynard,
but he had stopped just outside the door and
was carefully pocketing the red and green string.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small>THE FIFTH MAN</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">DR. HAYDEN threw aside the magazine he
had been reading and, making himself more
comfortable on the big lounge, puffed contentedly
at his cigar as he looked over to where
Jim Palmer and Peter Burnham sat playing chess.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you people finished the game yet?” he
asked, yawning openly.</p>

<p>His question met with no response from the absorbed
players, and curling up on the lounge the
tired physician burrowed his head among the sofa
cushions and dropped off to sleep. An hour later
Siki, Palmer’s Japanese servant, looked inside the
room which served Hayden and Palmer, who
shared the bachelor apartment, as living room and
dining room, and seeing the two men still deep in
their game, he withdrew as noiselessly as he had
come. He had barely reached the butler’s pantry
when the gong on the front door went off with a
resounding din. Gliding down the hallway Siki
opened the door and admitted Dan Maynard.</p>

<p>“Mr. Palmer is expecting me,” he said, handing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
his hat and cane to the servant, and stepped across
the reception hall. But before he reached the living
room the Japanese had gained the doorway.</p>

<p>“The Honorable Mr. Maynard,” he announced
and withdrew.</p>

<p>Palmer looked up from the chess table and waved
his hand.</p>

<p>“Sit down, Maynard, the game will be over in a
minute.”</p>

<p>Burnham, who had not glanced up, moved a
rook across the board. “It’s over now; mate in
three, Jim,” he announced, and threw himself back
in his chair and passed his hand across his hot
forehead. “Want your revenge now, Maynard?
I can play another game.”</p>

<p>“No, my revenge will keep,” laughed Maynard.
“You look used up, Burnham; too much concentration
is bad for you.”</p>

<p>Burnham yawned in answer and Palmer, rising,
lounged over to where Dr. Hayden lay comfortably
sleeping, snoring lustily.</p>

<p>“Wake up,” he exclaimed and enforced his remark
with a vigorous shake. “Maynard’s come
and Siki has some refreshments ready for us.” His
words were borne out by the entrance of the
Japanese with a tray laden with sandwiches and a
cellarette. Siki vanished, to return a minute later
with a chafing-dish containing lobster à la Newburg<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
which he placed on a table set for four places.</p>

<p>Dr. Hayden sat up and rubbed his sleepy eyes.
Catching sight of Maynard he bowed cordially as
he joined the others about the table.</p>

<p>“Good cook, Siki,” he remarked a little later
after sampling the hot lobster. “You are lucky
to have so excellent a servant, Palmer.”</p>

<p>Palmer made a wry face. “I won’t have him
long,” he grumbled. “He gave notice to-day; these
rich newcomers are playing hob with the domestic
service in Washington.” He paused and glanced
significantly at Burnham. “Don’t be so niggardly
with the decanter; pass it along,” he suggested.</p>

<p>Burnham was about to comply when Hayden
held up a protesting hand.</p>

<p>“Go easy, Palmer, or you will have another
attack,” he cautioned.</p>

<p>Palmer grinned sheepishly at Maynard. “Take
my advice,” he said. “Don’t invite your physician
to share your apartment if you want to enjoy life.
Hayden finds fault every time I forget I am on the
water-wagon.”</p>

<p>“Some people have peculiar ideas regarding their
welfare,” retorted Hayden. “Your heart won’t
stand many more attacks; so go easy.” Observing
Palmer’s obstinate expression, he added, “Move
the decanter out of Palmer’s way, Maynard, there’s
a good fellow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>As Maynard complied with the request his casual
glance at Palmer was arrested by the haggard lines
in his face and the puffiness under his eyes; he
looked what he evidently was, an ill man.</p>

<p>“Pooh!” Palmer exclaimed airily. “Sleep will
set me right. I believe the people in the apartment
above are to move out; once rid of their infernal
parties I’ll be able to work on my plans. An architect
needs peace and quiet as well as powerful
lights. This house is a sounding board.”</p>

<p>“Is it an old building?” asked Maynard.</p>

<p>“No, not very, built about ten years ago.”</p>

<p>“The rooms are very commodious,” commented
Maynard, looking around the room, which was arranged
with much artistic taste.</p>

<p>“Glad you like it,” exclaimed Palmer, much
gratified. “I was the architect. By the way, Burnham,
who do you suppose leased one of the smaller
apartments this summer? Marian Van Ness.”</p>

<p>“So she told me,” returned Burnham shortly.
Maynard, who had glanced up at mention of
Marian’s name, helped himself thoughtfully to
some Newburg.</p>

<p>“Any apartments vacant, Palmer?” he inquired.
The architect nodded affirmatively. “Then I
might rent one, as I plan to remain in Washington
until December at least.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>“Surely you will stay with us?” Burnham looked
hurt. “We want you to stay with us, Maynard.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure I won’t be imposing on your
hospitality?” asked Maynard. “I feel perhaps you
and Mrs. Burnham would rather not be bothered
with a guest just at this time.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense; we don’t want to be alone.” Burnham
spoke with great vehemence and his three companions
looked at him in surprise. With an effort
he strove to gain control over his emotion. “That—that
man’s death is getting on our nerves,” he
admitted, and the hand holding his wine glass
shook. “Neither my wife nor I feel the same since
the tragedy; it’s so—so devilish mysterious.”</p>

<p>“The police will soon clear it up,” said Hayden
cheerily. “Give them time, Burnham.”</p>

<p>“I would, if I had any faith in their methods,”
Burnham rejoined. “What have they done to
date? Nothing.”</p>

<p>“Apparently not a thing,” amended Maynard.
“The police don’t tell everything they know, Burnham;
they may have unearthed a whole lot which
will come out at the inquest.”</p>

<p>“Then I wish they would hold the trial,” Burnham
tossed down his napkin. “There is no reason in
such secrecy; let them arrest the murderer at
once.”</p>

<p>“Before they can do that they must establish the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
identity of the dead man.” Maynard waited until
Siki had removed his plate, then continued, “that
is the logical end to work from in solving the
riddle.”</p>

<p>Dr. Hayden nodded his agreement. “The police
are working along those lines,” he said. “To date
they have made but negative progress, and yet——”
He paused until Siki departed with the empty chafing
dish.</p>

<p>“What were you going to say?” demanded Burnham.</p>

<p>“Only that I stopped to see Coroner Penfield this
afternoon and found him working in his laboratory;
he was making a test of the dead man’s hair. You
noticed perhaps,” he broke off to ask Maynard who
was sitting forward in his chair, “that the man’s
hair was very closely cropped?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he responded. “It was so short that it
made his head look bullet shaped.”</p>

<p>“The coroner is nettled because this case has
baffled him, so he set his wits to work,” continued
Hayden. “He pulled out some of the short hair
from the man’s head with tweezers and steeped the
hair in diluted nitric acid.”</p>

<p>“With what result?” Burnham almost jerked out
the question.</p>

<p>“By tests with hydrochloric acid, Penfield found
that the hair had been dyed with nitrate of silver,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
answered Hayden. “And I found the same result
upon microscopic examination of a few hairs.”</p>

<p>“Well, what if you did find nitrate of silver?”
Burnham demanded roughly. “How does that advance
the inquiry?”</p>

<p>“It established the fact that the man had dyed
his hair,” explained the physician. “The inference
being he did so for purposes of disguise.”</p>

<p>Palmer, who had been an attentive listener to
all that was said, laughed heartily. “Oh, come,
Hayden,” he exclaimed. “That’s a broad statement.
I know a number of men, respectable citizens of
Washington, who dye their hair for no other reason
than to look younger.”</p>

<p>“Your friends have not been found dead under
mysterious circumstances,” said Hayden dryly. “In
the case in point we must consider the ulterior
motive; therefore this unidentified dead man can
be said to have dyed his hair from a motive of
disguise until it is proven otherwise.”</p>

<p>“I’ll admit it’s a nice point,” conceded Palmer,
twisting about in his chair. “Could you tell from
the examination, the original color of the man’s
hair?”</p>

<p>“Oh, bother!” broke in Burnham. “Who cares
about the color of his hair—how did his dead body
get in my house?”</p>

<p>“Walked there,” answered Maynard, a twinkle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
in his eyes belying his serious expression. “The
man couldn’t have been dead when he entered your
house.”</p>

<p>“He couldn’t, eh? Well, will you tell me where
he died in my house?” Burnham’s manner waxed
truculent. “I have searched every room with
Palmer and Detective Mitchell and we found no
trace of any one, let alone two persons, having
been there drinking—what was it? Oh, yes, cherry
brandy.”</p>

<p>“Every room was in order,” added Palmer. “No
sign of confusion. Frankly, I agree with Burnham,
the man must have been taken to his house, dead.”</p>

<p>Maynard stared at the speaker. “Do you mean
to tell me seriously that you two men believe a
dead body was carried into Burnham’s house in
broad daylight between the hours of three and five
in the afternoon without any one seeing it done?”</p>

<p>“I do,” announced Burnham firmly. “As to the
hours, don’t place too much reliance on Evelyn’s
statement regarding the time she found the body;
Evelyn is very heedless and a few hours miscalculation
in time wouldn’t disturb her.”</p>

<p>A subtle change in Burnham’s tone as he mentioned
Evelyn’s name caught Maynard’s attention
and looking up quickly he saw Palmer was watching
Burnham, a curious glint in his eye which
Maynard found difficult to fathom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>“Evelyn told me that she had her watch examined
and that it keeps excellent time,” stated Hayden.
“Of course we are all liable to make mistakes in
the hour; but in this instance Evelyn is unshaken
in her belief that she found the body in the library
at about four o’clock, and that it was not there
when she was in the room at half past two.”</p>

<p>“There would be no object in Evelyn lying as
to the time,” exclaimed Palmer, and his heavy
frown indicated his temper was rising. “I hardly
think, Burnham, you can impugn her testimony.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be a fool!” retorted Burnham hotly. “The
girl is proverbially careless; carelessness is at the
bottom of the confusion in time.”</p>

<p>Only Hayden’s strong hand kept Palmer in his
seat. “Don’t excite yourself, Burnham,” he advised
sternly, “and tell us quietly just what your
theory is regarding the murder. As for you,
Palmer, shut up!” His half-bantering tone conveyed
a deeper meaning and Palmer, observing Burnham’s
flushed countenance, held back his angry answer.</p>

<p>“My theory,” repeated Burnham thoughtfully, as
he passed a damp handkerchief across his face.
“The man was taken to my house dead and the
murderer made his escape before Evelyn came up
from the kitchen.”</p>

<p>“Just a moment.” Hayden leaned forward. “Why<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
did the murderer ring the library bell to summon
Evelyn?”</p>

<p>“How do I know?” Burnham’s excitement was
mounting the more he talked. “Probably he did it
in a moment of—of mental aberration.”</p>

<p>Hayden chuckled. “Well, putting that point
aside for a moment,” he said, “there is the question
of getting the body through the streets and up your
steps unseen in broad daylight by any passers-by.”</p>

<p>“Confound it!” Burnham banged the table with
his clenched fist until the glasses rattled. “Why do
you keep harping on daylight? The coroner claims
that the man died between two and three Tuesday
morning; the murderer had ample time <i>before</i> daylight
to take the body to my house——”</p>

<p>“But Evelyn did not find the body until Tuesday
afternoon,” interrupted Palmer heatedly.</p>

<p>“She did not find the body in the library until
Tuesday afternoon,” retorted Burnham. “But I
am willing to bet any amount that had Evelyn
looked through the entire house she would have
found it concealed somewhere on the premises.”</p>

<p>In the silence that ensued Burnham glanced
triumphantly at his companions, but their expression
disappointed him; his theory had not created the
sensation he had expected.</p>

<p>“Of course the body was in the house,” answered
Hayden. “It had to be there that length of time,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
for the man was dead hours before Evelyn found
him. Why the body was moved into the library,
why the murderer returned to the scene of his
crime, and why he rang the library bell are problems
yet to be solved.”</p>

<p>“There is a point you are all overlooking,” broke
in Palmer. “Where did the murderer get the keys
to your house? There is no evidence to show he
broke into the house, therefore he must have used
a key.”</p>

<p>Burnham did not reply at once. “There are dishonest
locksmiths, I suppose, as well as crooks in
other trades,” he said finally. “The lock on the
front door is old fashioned, and the same key opens
the outer vestibule door also.”</p>

<p>“Not a very secure arrangement,” remarked
Maynard. “Then you think keys were made to
fit the doors in your absence this summer?”</p>

<p>“Yes. It would be an easy matter for a man to
get a wax impression of the lock at night without
attracting attention. The few people on our block
who are home are at work all day and at the club
at night; that is why,” added Burnham obstinately,
“the dead man could have been brought at
any hour to the house unknown to any one.”</p>

<p>“You mean brought in a cab?” inquired Maynard.</p>

<p>“Of course. A dead man couldn’t be carried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
through the streets without being seen by some
one,” replied Burnham. “Have a little sense!”</p>

<p>Maynard paid no attention to his companion’s
irritability.</p>

<p>“So you think the dead man was carried to your
house in a cab,” he mused. “If that was the case
it simplifies the search.”</p>

<p>“How so?” The question came from Palmer and
Maynard turned slightly to face him.</p>

<p>“It should be a comparatively easy matter to trace
the cab driver,” he said.</p>

<p>“An excellent idea,” agreed Hayden. “Provided,
of course, that Burnham’s theory is correct—that
the man was first murdered and then carried into
his house. Frankly, as a medical man I don’t agree
with Burnham’s reasoning; a dead body is a very
unwieldy object to move around and would most
certainly attract attention.”</p>

<p>“The man was only of medium height and thin,”
protested Burnham, and then added in haste which
Maynard was quick to note, “that is, judging from
the glimpse I had of the body on the billiard table.
Palmer,” as the latter rose, “hand me a cigar from
the box on the mantel, thanks,” and he borrowed
Maynard’s cigarette to light the fresh cigar.</p>

<p>The silence continued as Palmer, his big form
moving quietly down the room, reached one of the
front windows and opened it wide. For a short<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
time he stood contemplating the opposite houses,
dimly seen in the murky atmosphere, and filled his
lungs with the damp air. Hearing his name he
faced about.</p>

<p>“Have you disappeared for good, Palmer?” called
Burnham. “We must be getting along. I——”</p>

<p>Whatever Burnham intended to say remained unuttered
as a stinging sensation caused him to clap
his hand to his face. When he removed it his
palm showed blood from a graze on his cheek.</p>

<p>“Shot, by God!” he exclaimed, gazing dazedly at
his companions.</p>

<p>Palmer moved swiftly from the window and
peered over Hayden’s shoulder at a hole in the
plaster—the bullet had mushroomed out. Maynard
tapped the wall. “Brick,” he said tersely, and his
face shone white in the rays of the electric lamp
which Palmer held aloft to better inspect the bullet.
“I heard no sound.”</p>

<p>“None of us did,” responded Burnham hoarsely.
“Whoever fired the shot used a Maxim silencer.”</p>

<p>Hayden moistened his finger and touched the
hot metal. “Fortunate you moved your head when
you did, Burnham,” he commented dryly. “Where
did the shot come from?”</p>

<p>A sudden stronger puff of air rattled the newspapers
lying near the open window and the men
turned in that direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>“Jove! the window!” Palmer sped in that direction.
“I saw no one on the balcony when I looked
out a few minutes ago; then you called, Burnham.”</p>

<p>Maynard, who had hurried with him to the window,
leaned far out, and looked up and down the
balcony which ran across the front of the apartment.</p>

<p>“Who owns the next apartment?” he demanded,
observing that another window opened upon the
balcony. “There, where the window is.”</p>

<p>“That’s our hall window,” explained Palmer.
Turning on his heel he hurried into the reception
hall with such speed that he collided violently with
his Japanese servant. “Siki, what are you doing
here?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“I come to answer the door, most honorable sir,”
responded the servant and glancing ahead Palmer
saw the front door to his apartment was ajar and
that a shadowy form stood in the corridor just
outside the entrance.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” he asked, pushing Siki to
one side and switching on an additional light; by
its aid he saw that the man in the corridor was
a French officer.</p>

<p>“I come to inquire the way to the apartment of
Madame Van Ness,” the Frenchman stated, observing
with well-bred surprise Palmer’s agitated appearance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>“Right upstairs, next floor,” the latter snapped,
and shutting the door he was in time to catch Burnham
as he staggered to a seat in nervous collapse.</p>

<p>“It’s that damned Frenchman——” Burnham
could hardly articulate, and Hayden hastened to
his aid. “He tried to kill me.”</p>

<p>“He—who?” demanded Maynard who had lingered
behind at the window to look up and down
the street before joining them. “Who tried to kill
you?”</p>

<p>“René La Montagne!” gasped Burnham and
slipped back insensible.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small>FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">UNDER the full glare of the electric lights
which he had turned on, Palmer tramped
uneasily up and down his living room while
he waited for Hayden to return from the bedroom
where the three men had taken Peter Burnham
twenty minutes before. Maynard, more self-controlled,
sat before the chess board and, utterly lost
to his companion’s continued restlessness, he moved
the chessmen about intent only on solving some
abstruse problem. The minutes dragged along before
Palmer’s impatience was finally rewarded by
the entrance of the physician.</p>

<p>“Burnham has regained consciousness and is resting
more easily,” he announced, as the two men
came toward him. “If he continues to improve I
see no reason why he should not return home a little
later; if not——”</p>

<p>“He can have my bedroom,” interrupted Palmer.
“But some one will have to tell Mrs. Burnham;”
Palmer did not look happy at the thought. “Guess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
it’s up to you, Maynard, to break the news; you
are their house guest.”</p>

<p>Hayden walked over to the wall and stared at
the bullet then, without speaking to his companions,
he paced off the distance to the window facing the
balcony which still remained open, and reaching
there he turned and studied the room.</p>

<p>“The bullet must have come from this direction,”
he said. “Burnham was sitting directly in the line
of fire. Did you see any one lurking on the balcony,
Palmer, when you looked out?”</p>

<p>“No, and yet some one must have been hiding
there.” Palmer stepped over to the window. “It’s
a dark night”—pointing to the overcast sky and
foggy atmosphere, “and the light in this room made
the balcony darker by contrast. I don’t see how
any one could have gotten on the balcony from the
hall in the brief time which elapsed between my
turning my back to the window and the firing of
the shot; it was like that——” A snap of his fingers
illustrated his meaning.</p>

<p>Maynard moved nearer. “An agile man could
do it,” he spoke with conviction. “I found the
balcony window in the hall standing wide open.”</p>

<p>Palmer walked down the room to the desk telephone.
“Then I think we had better call in the
police,” he said. “Captain La Montagne can explain
his presence in the corridor to them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>“He did, to you,” retorted Maynard warmly. “He
stated he was looking for Mrs. Van Ness’ apartment.
La Montagne is absolutely straight; I have
known him for years, he would not stoop to assassination.”</p>

<p>“But Burnham’s words implied——” objected
Palmer.</p>

<p>“Don’t place too much reliance in Burnham’s
statement,” interrupted Hayden. “He made it when
half delirious; better wait until he is in a condition
to explain more fully the grounds for the animosity
which, judging from his remark, exists between him
and La Montagne.”</p>

<p>“A wise suggestion,” declared Maynard heartily.
“Doctor, you have sense; now, Palmer, put down
the telephone and let us investigate this matter ourselves
without calling in the police, at any rate not
now,” he added, seeing Palmer still kept hold of
the telephone. “Suppose I go up to Mrs. Van Ness’
apartment and see if La Montagne is there, then I’ll
come back and report what I learn.”</p>

<p>Palmer set the telephone back on the desk. “I’ll
go with you,” he announced. “Siki’s here, Hayden;
if you need aid in looking after Burnham just ring
for him, or send him up for us. Come on,
Maynard,” and he started for the door, Maynard
keeping step with him. They found the corridor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
deserted as they walked down its length toward the
staircase.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Van Ness’ apartment is on the next floor,”
remarked Palmer. “No need of taking the elevator,”
and in silence the two men mounted the stairs.</p>

<p>On reaching the top Maynard, who was slightly
in advance of his companion, found the corridor
blocked by several suit cases and a trunk. A man,
standing by the freight elevator shaft, left off ringing
the bell and hurried toward Maynard.</p>

<p>“Beg pardon,” he exclaimed, hauling the trunk
to one side to permit Maynard and Palmer passing
along. “I thought the elevator would be here now.
Evening, Mr. Palmer,” and he touched his cap on
recognizing the architect.</p>

<p>“Oh, Sam!” Palmer nodded affably to the taxi-driver.
“Who’s moving out to-night?”</p>

<p>“The party in ‘41,’ sir; and he’s agoin’ to miss
his train if he don’t look sharp;” Sam pushed back
his cap to mop the damp red hair which tumbled
down on his forehead. “He was to send the janitor
up on the freighter for his things, but I bet he’s
asittin’ in my car awonderin’ where I’m at; these
here foreigners are mighty queer actin’ sometimes.”</p>

<p>Palmer laughed. “I’m glad ‘41’ is leaving; I
shan’t be annoyed by his noisy parties over my
head. Here’s the elevator now, Sam, good-night,”
and not waiting for Sam’s response Palmer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
hastened after Maynard who had strolled down
one of the wings of the building opening front the
main corridor.</p>

<p>“Which way?” he inquired, turning about as
Palmer reached him.</p>

<p>“That further door, there,” and striding forward
Palmer laid an impatient finger on the bell. There
was a slight delay, then the door was opened by an
old colored Mammy, her black face in striking contrast
to her snow white apron, cuffs, and collar.</p>

<p>“Can we see Mrs. Van Ness?” asked Palmer.
“Say Mr. Maynard and Mr. Palmer.” As Mammy
opened the door still further he entered the small
anteroom just as Marian Van Ness appeared in the
doorway of her parlor. There was a slight pause
of uncertainty in her manner, at least one of the
men judged so, before she advanced to greet them.</p>

<p>“Come in,” she said and led the way into the
parlor. Evelyn, sitting with René La Montagne on
the sofa, looked up with some alarm at Palmer, but
a glimpse of Maynard just behind him brought a
quick smile of pleasure in its train.</p>

<p>La Montagne, springing to his feet, hailed Maynard
with a joyous exclamation.</p>

<p>“Ah, <i>mon ami</i>, well met!” He shook Maynard’s
hand with effusion. “How is it with you?”</p>

<p>“Well, René.” Maynard’s eyes twinkled as he
caught Evelyn’s embarrassed greeting of Palmer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
and the older man’s scowl as he acknowledged with
scant courtesy Marian’s introduction to the French
officer. Palmer had not anticipated seeing Evelyn,
but with the assurance which characterized all his
actions, he promptly took the seat by her side left
vacant by La Montagne and addressed her in so
low a tone that the others were left to chatter
together.</p>

<p>For the first five minutes La Montagne bore the
brunt of making conversation and Maynard improved
the opportunity to silently observe the attractive
room in which they sat, but even as he
studied the few good paintings and pictures on the
walls his eyes turned back with ever quickening
interest to Marian who, in her simple evening gown,
engrossed his attention. Her charm, however, did
not lie in the perfect fit of her gown, her dark
eyes and their long lashes, or the soft pink of her
cheeks which deepened and paled as she talked,
but in an indefinite something called, for want of
a better name, personality.</p>

<p>“We were just discussing you, Mr. Maynard,”
she said, catching his eye as he again looked at
her. “I have persuaded Evelyn and Captain
La Montagne to take part in a Red Cross benefit
tableau and play to be given Saturday at the
Belasco, and Evelyn wondered if you would aid us
with suggestions.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>“I shall be delighted to,” was Maynard’s quick
response. “What are the tableaux to be?”</p>

<p>“Patriotic scenes and representations of our
heroic Allies,” explained Marian hurriedly; she had
been quick to perceive La Montagne’s restless
glances at Evelyn and his evident anger at the prolonged
tête-à-tête which Palmer was having with
her. She raised her voice as she turned her chair
slightly nearer the sofa, “I already have your costume
ordered, Evelyn; your tableau will not require
much rehearsing.”</p>

<p>“I’ll ask Mother if I may take part,” replied
Evelyn, glad of an opportunity to make the conversation
general. She recalled her confidences of
the morning to La Montagne regarding Palmer, and
to flaunt an apparent flirtation in the face of her
French lover was repugnant to her frank and loyal
nature. “All fashionable Washington is taking
part in the benefit, Mr. Maynard; won’t you help
us?”</p>

<p>“I certainly will.” Maynard smiled at the enthusiasm
with which she put the question. “Why not
give me a part?”</p>

<p>“You!” Evelyn’s eyes opened wide. “My
goodness, we would be afraid to act with you—the
girls would all be stricken dumb.”</p>

<p>“Let me have the mute’s part,” laughed Maynard.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
“Really, I am not so terrifying, am I?” appealing
directly to Marian.</p>

<p>“Not so very,” she responded a trifle absently.
“The play is trite, some society hodge-podge and
not—not,” she stumbled in her speech and continued
quickly, “not worthy your histrionic talent,
Mr. Maynard, but there is a tableau which, if you
would undertake, would be a great drawing card.”</p>

<p>“Put me down for it,” declared Maynard. “And
let me know the hours of rehearsal. How about
you, Palmer; are you doing your bit in the benefit?”</p>

<p>“I’m helping with the stage effects.” Palmer
shrugged his shoulders indifferently. “Not much
work there, for the local theaters have loaned all
necessary scenery.”</p>

<p>“What part have you planned for me, Madame
Van Ness?” asked La Montagne while his eyes
eagerly sought Evelyn, who answered his question
with a saucy smile.</p>

<p>“I hear you are to sing the ‘<i>Marseillaise</i>,’” she
said. “Now, don’t refuse.”</p>

<p>“Refuse? I?” La Montagne would have risen
and gone to her, but the pressure of Maynard’s
foot on his under the table recalled the excitable
Frenchman to the fact that he and Evelyn were
not alone. “I will do anything,” he announced.
“I but await orders.”</p>

<p>“That is what we all do these days,” broke in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
Maynard. He glanced at Palmer and at La Montagne;
would Palmer make the first move to go, or
was he waiting for him to do so? Evelyn’s presence
complicated the situation; he did not wish to
tell her that her step-father had been shot and
narrowly escaped death; nor did he wish La Montagne
to leave before he could question him as to
his presence in the corridor outside Palmer’s open
hall door just after the attempted assassination.
He, himself, could not go without offering to see
Evelyn home, and courtesy demanded that he wait
for her to make the first move to leave. For all his
self-control Maynard was conscious of a desire to
throttle Palmer who, having captured the conversational
ball, was keeping it rolling by talking every
instant. Maynard wondered if Palmer had forgotten
the errand which had brought them there in
his absorption in Evelyn and his endeavor to
monopolize her.</p>

<p>Maynard rested his elbow on a mahogany table
by which he sat, but his elbow slipped on the polished
surface and a shower of papers, dislodged by
his sudden movement, slid to the floor. With a
quick word of apology he stooped to pick them up,
La Montagne lending his assistance.</p>

<p>“It is really my fault,” exclaimed Evelyn who
had turned to see what the commotion was about.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
“I had no business to leave your papers there,
Marian.”</p>

<p>“My papers!” echoed Marian. “What papers do
you refer to, Evelyn?”</p>

<p>“Why those Captain La Montagne asked me to
return to you.” Evelyn bit her lip; she had spoken
hastily, forgetting that she had decided to tell no
one of meeting La Montagne in Potomac Park that
morning. Palmer would be very likely to tell her
mother or worse, her step-father. Again Evelyn
bit her lip in vexation.</p>

<p>“They are the papers I carried home for you
and carelessly left them in my tunic, Madame,”
explained La Montagne. “I, fearing I might not
meet you so immediately, asked Miss Preston
that she take them in charge. I trust my walk-away
with the papers did not distress you, Madame
Van Ness?”</p>

<p>Marian’s smile was very charming. “You have
not inconvenienced me,” she said. “The papers
were unimportant. Must you be going?” she added
swiftly, seeing Palmer rise. The architect, surprised
by the question, stared at her in some confusion;
he had simply risen because he was too
nervous to sit still longer. Maynard, mistaking
Palmer’s confusion for hesitancy, rose also.</p>

<p>“We must be off,” he said. “Just dropped in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
for a friendly chat. Can’t I see you home,
Evelyn?”</p>

<p>“Thanks, Mr. Maynard, but I am spending the
night with Marian. Are you going also?” as La
Montagne seeing the two men remained standing,
rose to his feet. Before the Frenchman could answer
her question, Maynard spoke for him.</p>

<p>“We are going to carry off René,” he laughed.
“Don’t begrudge us the privilege of a talk about
France, Evelyn; I have messages for La Montagne,
Mrs. Van Ness.” His direct gaze held hers. “I
hope very soon to be a neighbor of yours as Palmer
tells me there is a vacant apartment in the building.
Will you let me come and see you again?”</p>

<p>Marian held out her hand; it remained but a
second in his strong clasp, then was withdrawn.
“I shall always be happy to see you and Mr.
Palmer,” she announced, and the inclusion of
Palmer’s name robbed the message of any special
cordiality to Maynard alone.</p>

<p>Palmer’s reply was mingled with his good-byes to
Evelyn; he was determined to have the last word
with her, but La Montagne out-maneuvered him
and, just as the other men stepped into the corridor,
he whisked back into the apartment, to return a
second later to the corridor smiling happily.</p>

<p>“Pardon!” he exclaimed blandly. “Shall we take
the elevator or walk?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>“Walk,” jerked out Palmer, his temper getting
the upper hand, and La Montagne’s eyebrows rose
as he glanced significantly at Maynard. He said
nothing more, however, and accompanied his companions
in silence to the next floor where Palmer
halted.</p>

<p>“Will you please explain,” he began, “why you
stopped at the door of my apartment earlier this
evening?”</p>

<p>“To inquire the direction of Madame Van Ness’
apartment.” La Montagne glanced at him in mild
surprise. “I told you so when you questioned me
before.”</p>

<p>“So you did; but you did not tell me why you
walked into my apartment and out on the balcony,”
retorted Palmer.</p>

<p>“But I did no such action,” La Montagne looked
in bewilderment at Maynard standing silently by
them.</p>

<p>“Tell us, La Montagne,” began Maynard hurriedly,
and thereby checking Palmer’s next question,
“did you find the front door of the apartment
ajar?”</p>

<p>“Do you mean opened?” Maynard nodded.
“But yes, and hearing voices inside I thought to
inquire my way.”</p>

<p>“Inquire your way,” repeated Palmer mechanically.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
“I have seen you often this autumn going
upstairs in this building.”</p>

<p>“True, to visit my friend, Major Jean,” calmly.
“He left to-day.” La Montague looked more
closely at Maynard and Palmer and their serious
manner surprised him. “I fear I unintentionally
intruded by stopping at your door,” he said haughtily,
as he straightened himself. “I would not have
risked disturbing you, but that I saw a man leave
your door a second before.”</p>

<p>“A man!” Palmer came closer. “Did you see
who he was?”</p>

<p>“I called to him to wait,” went on La Montagne,
not answering the question directly. “But he did
not evidently hear my hail or my question regarding
Madame Van Ness’ apartment, for he did not stop.”</p>

<p>Maynard, listening with eager attention, looked
his disappointment.</p>

<p>“Have you no idea who the man was?” he demanded.
“It’s important, René; can you not describe
the man?”</p>

<p>“Only that he wore the costume of a chauffeur,”
responded the French officer. “I took him to be a
taxi-driver.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>THE TELEGRAM</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">JONES, on his way up the stairs to the housekeeper’s
suite of rooms on the third floor, was
startled by the unexpected appearance of Mrs.
Burnham at his elbow. Absorbed in carrying the
heavily laden tray without spilling its contents he
had failed to hear her footstep on the stair behind
him.</p>

<p>“It strikes me, Jones, that you have a hearty
meal there for a sick woman,” she remarked, inspecting
the hot dishes with a critical eye.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Ward sent down word she particularly
wanted a steak and all the rest,” stammered Jones.
“Cook and I just carried out her orders, ma’am.
Shall I take off any of the dishes?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; see that Mrs. Ward has every attention,
Jones. I was only wondering——” Mrs. Burnham
paused thoughtfully; the housekeeper was indulging
in a very substantial meal for one who claimed to be
a seriously ill woman. “Carry the tray to Mrs.
Ward, Jones, but see that you do not mention my
comment upon her appetite.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>“Yes, ma’am, certainly, ma’am,” stuttered Jones
and hurried on his way. He stood in great awe of
Mrs. Burnham, whose caustic comments when she
found him careless in his work had made an
indelible impression.</p>

<p>Jones’ tap at the housekeeper’s door brought a
pretty chambermaid who dimpled into a smile at
sight of him. They had no opportunity to exchange
a word, for Mrs. Ward called to her to take
the tray and shut the door.</p>

<p>“Put the tray here,” she directed, tapping the
chair by her bed. “That will do,” she added a
moment later as the maid arranged the dishes within
easy reach of her hand. “Thank you, don’t wait
any longer.”</p>

<p>Waiting until the pretty chambermaid had disappeared
into the adjoining room, Mrs. Ward listened
until her sharp ears caught the click of the
latch of her sitting room door and convinced her
that she was alone. Raising herself on her elbow
she proceeded to eat with avidity. She had just
finished the last morsel of bread when the door of
her bedroom opened and Mrs. Burnham walked in.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Matilda,” she said cheerily.
“Glad to see you are so much better.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ward settled back on her pillow and pulled
the bedclothes up about her throat.</p>

<p>“Good morning,” she replied. “It’s very good of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
you to come and see me so early in the morning.”
Mrs. Burnham, who was not noted for early rising,
flushed at the housekeeper’s insolent air; she was
a woman, however, who carried the war into Africa
when occasion arose, and discourtesy from a
subordinate or servant instantly aroused her resentment.</p>

<p>“I expected to find you up, Matilda,” she said.
“Dr. Hayden told me last evening that he had
crossed you off his list of sick patients.”</p>

<p>“I know how I feel better than Dr. Hayden,”
responded Mrs. Ward sullenly. “I am not able
to work; I am as weak as a kitten.”</p>

<p>“Staying in bed won’t strengthen you,” answered
Mrs. Burnham practically. “Come, be sensible,
follow Dr. Hayden’s orders.”</p>

<p>“I shan’t.”</p>

<p>“But, Matilda, you can’t stay in bed——”</p>

<p>“I can, too; until I am strong enough to get up,”
with sullen anger. “I need nourishing food and
rest. I’ve worked hard all summer, Mrs. Burnham;
surely you don’t begrudge me a few crumbs?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burnham eyed her wrathfully. “You can
hardly call your breakfast a ‘few crumbs,’” she
retorted, pointing to the empty dishes. “You have
licked the platters clean, Matilda,” a spark of humor
lighting her eyes. “What nonsense! Of course,
I don’t begrudge you all the good cooking you require,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
and a nurse if necessary; but I do object to
your malingering.”</p>

<p>“I am not malingering.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you are,” with stern emphasis. “And
I want to know <i>why</i>?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ward clutched the bedclothes, but a look
at Mrs. Burnham’s face made her change her angry
answer to a more wheedling tone than she had intended
using.</p>

<p>“After all my years of faithful service you come
and accuse me of that,” she began. “I wouldn’t
’a’ thought it of you, Mrs. Burnham.” Her face
worked and a few tears brimmed over her eyelids
and ran down on the coverlet.</p>

<p>“Stop crying!” exclaimed Mrs. Burnham. “I
have no intention of hurting your feelings, Matilda;
I came here to get facts.”</p>

<p>“Facts about what?”</p>

<p>“About what transpired in this house on Monday
and Tuesday last.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ward shook her head. “I can’t help you
there,” she replied. “I’m plain puzzled myself.”</p>

<p>“There is always a solution to a puzzle,” responded
Mrs. Burnham. “Answer my questions
and we will find it. At what hour did you reach
this house?”</p>

<p>“Tuesday afternoon, just after Miss Evelyn
found the dead man.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>“And where did you spend Monday night?” Mrs.
Ward’s eyelids flickered and Mrs. Burnham continued
tranquilly: “I am quite aware you left
Chelsea Monday afternoon, Matilda.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ward made no response and after a
lengthened pause Mrs. Burnham spoke again.
“Why did you come to Washington twenty-four
hours before you were told to?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t,” replied Mrs. Ward hotly. “I had to
go to Baltimore on business; the wire came for me
after you had left for New York. The servants
all had their Washington railroad tickets for Tuesday
and the house was even then in order; so I
didn’t see any harm, ma’am, in leaving Jones to
close the house. You’ve always trusted him.”</p>

<p>“I still trust Jones,” dryly. “That is not the
point. I wish to know why you displayed so much
emotion on the discovery of the dead man in our
library.”</p>

<p>For answer Mrs. Ward felt about under the
bolster and produced a much thumbed telegram
which she handed to Mrs. Burnham who read the
brief message it bore:</p>

<p class="center"><i>Mother worse. Come.</i></p>

<p class="center"><span class="indentleft"><i>Annie.</i></span></p>

<p>“Who is Annie?” she inquired, handing back the
telegram.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>“My niece.” Mrs. Ward wiped her eyes with a
corner of the sheet and thereby concealed from
view a red and green string which had slipped from
under the bolster in her exertions of searching for
the telegram. “My sister died just after I got
there.” Mrs. Ward was talking volubly as she
pushed the string safely beneath the bedclothes.
“Her death was a great grief; and on top of it,
I found a dead man here—it clean bowled me over,
for I’m not as young as I was, Mrs. Burnham.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burnham considered her housekeeper in
silence; she was certainly thinner than she had
seen her in some time, and there were heavy lines in
her face which had not been in evidence a week
before. Another look at the empty breakfast
dishes convinced Mrs. Burnham that the two spots
of color in Mrs. Ward’s cheeks came from temper
and not from temperature, unless so much food
had made her ill. Had she really eaten it all
herself? From where she sat Mrs. Burnham had
a good view under the four-post bed occupied by
the housekeeper; certainly no one was concealed
there. Bending a little forward, she managed to see
inside of the closet, the door of which stood partly
open; no one was there. Mrs. Burnham sighed.
She did not like mysteries, her forte did not lie in
solving them. The bedroom and the sitting room
and bath opening from it, all of which were given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
over to Mrs. Ward, were just above her boudoir,
and the room’s shape, like the boudoir, was
octagonal.</p>

<p>A discreet knock on the door broke the silence,
and in response to Mrs. Burnham’s “Come in,”
the pretty chambermaid entered.</p>

<p>“Mr. Burnham wishes to see you, ma’am,” she
said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burnham rose instantly. “Don’t go, Cora;
I want you to help Mrs. Ward dress.” Meeting the
housekeeper’s irate glare, she continued unruffled:
“It is too weakening for you to remain in bed,
Matilda, Cora will bring your meals to your sitting
room to-day. To-morrow—we’ll see how you are
to-morrow,” and with a friendly wave of her hand
she left the housekeeper glaring indignantly at the
smiling Cora.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burnham went at once to her husband’s
bedroom; not finding him there, she went to her
own room, and from there to her boudoir. Her
husband dropped the newspaper he was reading
and looked up impatiently as she appeared.</p>

<p>“Upon my word, Peter,” she said. “Dr. Hayden
orders you to stay in bed and Matilda to get up;
instead of which you get up and she stays in bed—nice
obedient patients you are!”</p>

<p>“Hayden’s a fool!” growled Burnham. “I must
go down to Palmer’s office this morning, Lillian;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
now, I don’t wish to discuss the matter with you,
just call a taxi—there’s a dear.”</p>

<p>Instead of complying with his request Mrs.
Burnham sat down in the nearest chair and contemplated
her husband.</p>

<p>“Dan Maynard has gone to see Jim and is bringing
him back to lunch,” she said. “You will have
to possess your soul in patience until then, Peter.
I have no idea of letting you go out with your
temperature.”</p>

<p>“Temperature! Fiddle-sticks! I am just a bit
feverish.” Burnham stroked his cheek until he became
conscious that his wife was regarding the
strip of plaster across his face with interest. “I
scratched myself in shaving,” he explained hurriedly.
“I wish you wouldn’t sit there and look
at me.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burnham laughed as she leaned forward
and picked up her knitting bag from her sewing
table. “I am afraid, my dear, you will have to learn
to control your nerves; especially if you want to
shave yourself and preserve your good looks at the
same time,” she remarked kindly. “Go on reading
your paper, Peter.”</p>

<p>Burnham kicked the paper contemptuously.
“Nothing in it but war news,” he said. “I’m sick
of the war.”</p>

<p>“So are we all, but we are going to win it just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
the same.” Mrs. Burnham shook the khaki sweater
she was knitting with vigor. “Every stitch helps.”</p>

<p>“Hump! You knitters remind me of the women
who sat at the foot of the guillotine in the French
Revolution,” grumbled Burnham. “I never saw a
woman yet who wasn’t attracted by crime and war
is a gigantic crime.”</p>

<p>“Peter!” Mrs. Burnham straightened up and her
indignation was plainly manifest. “You must be
out of your head; don’t utter any more such remarks
in my presence.”</p>

<p>“Well, why don’t you order that taxi-cab?”</p>

<p>“Because Dr. Hayden said you were to—What is
it, Jones?” she broke off to ask as the butler came
into the room.</p>

<p>“Mr. Palmer, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“Ask him up.” Burnham half rose, then sank
back and his wife observed his sudden pallor with
concern. “Would you mind leaving us together,
Lillian? I want to speak to Palmer confidentially
about my—my affairs.”</p>

<p>“Are you strong enough? Better wait, Peter,”
she coaxed; an obstinate frown was her only answer,
and before she could raise further objections
James Palmer was ushered in by Jones.</p>

<p>“You come at an opportune moment, James,”
exclaimed Mrs. Burnham, shaking hands cordially.
“Peter was determined to go and see you, notwithstanding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
I told him Dan Maynard would bring you
back to lunch with us.”</p>

<p>Burnham, who had darted an impatient look at
his wife, pointed to a chair near the one he occupied.</p>

<p>“Sit down,” he suggested. “The police have
barred us from the library; most insulting, I call
it,” he added bitterly. “So we shall have to smoke
here; if you don’t mind, Lillian?”</p>

<p>“Not in the least.” Contrary to her husband’s
hopes Mrs. Burnham made no motion to leave the
room, but instead went placidly on with her knitting.
“Did you meet Evelyn downstairs, James?”</p>

<p>“No. I haven’t seen her since last night, when,
calling on Mrs. Van Ness, I found her there.”
Palmer paused to pick up the newspaper which lay
at his feet, and folded it neatly before laying it on
the sewing table.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Van Ness,” repeated Burnham thoughtfully.
“Oh, didn’t Captain La Montagne mention
last night that he was looking for Marian Van
Ness’ apartment, Palmer?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Palmer looked over at Burnham and their
glances met. “The captain was with Mrs. Van
Ness and Evelyn when I called there.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burnham missed a stitch and when she again
looked up from her knitting she found her husband<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
gazing out of the window and Palmer just
lighting a cigarette.</p>

<p>“With your permission,” he said, holding it up.</p>

<p>“Certainly; I don’t object to tobacco smoke.”
She was about to resume her knitting when her
glance strayed through the open door by which she
sat and she recognized Dr. Hayden coming down
the hall. “Excuse me,” she exclaimed, “I’ll be
back in a moment,” and she slipped out of the room
before her husband looked around.</p>

<p>Hurrying down the hall Mrs. Burnham encountered
Hayden near her bedroom and with a bare
word of greeting opened the door and led him
inside the room.</p>

<p>“You have two rebellious patients, Doctor; my
husband and Mrs. Ward,” she began.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Ward shouldn’t give you any concern,”
replied Hayden. “She has recovered; but your
husband had a touch of fever last night which may
make him a bit, eh, fractious,” hesitating for a
word as he saw how worried she was.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am not anxious about Peter, I can manage
him,” she said confidently. “It’s Mrs. Ward; why
is she malingering?”</p>

<p>Hayden looked at her in surprise. “Is she?”</p>

<p>“In my opinion she is,” with emphasis. “Wait;
I’ve noticed that whenever the coroner or the detectives
wish to interview her, Mrs. Ward always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
becomes worse or says so, and just to satisfy myself
I examined the nurse’s chart and found
nothing on it to indicate such changes in her condition.
To-day she refused to get up.”</p>

<p>“She did? But I told her last night——”</p>

<p>“I know, I heard you. She ate a large and substantial
breakfast and then had the effrontery to
tell me that she was too weak to get out of bed.
I know a sick woman when I see one,” ended Mrs.
Burnham with vigor, “and in my opinion she is
no invalid.”</p>

<p>“I shall talk to her,” and Hayden’s square jaw
became more pronounced.</p>

<p>“Do, please. Wait just a moment; why is she
malingering?”</p>

<p>Hayden pondered the question before answering.
“It may be, considering her emotion after the discovery
of the dead man and her attempts to avoid
interviews with Coroner Penfield and Detective
Mitchell, that she hopes to get out of attending the
inquest as a witness.”</p>

<p>“I believe you’ve hit it,” ejaculated Mrs. Burnham.
“I’ve been questioning Mrs. Ward this
morning about her actions on Monday and Tuesday,
and to be quite frank her answers did not
ring true.”</p>

<p>“Ah, indeed. What did she say?”</p>

<p>“She stated that she left Chelsea a day earlier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
than she had intended on the receipt of a telegram
from her niece saying her mother was ill. Mrs.
Ward went on to say that her sister died shortly
after her arrival in Baltimore, and the shock of
finding a dead man here on top of her grief for
her sister upset her.”</p>

<p>Hayden listened with close attention. “Did you
see the telegram?”</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“Then Mrs. Ward has told a straight story apparently.”
Mrs. Burnham’s expression grew peculiar
and he asked quickly, “Have you reason to
doubt it?”</p>

<p>“Only this,” she hesitated. “Please keep this
confidential. When I engaged Mrs. Ward as my
housekeeper three years ago she distinctly told me
that she had no relatives living in this country.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small>“SEDITIOUS UTTERANCES”</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">PALMER, fussing among his blue prints,
looked up as his stenographer ushered Dan
Maynard into his office.</p>

<p>“Sit down,” he exclaimed heartily. “I was
afraid you wouldn’t come back after all; you need
not wait, Miss Hall,” and the stenographer walked
out, closing the door behind her. Palmer swung
his swivel-chair about so as to face his visitor who
had selected a seat near the desk. “I stopped at
the Burnhams’ particularly to see you, but found
you had left to come here.”</p>

<p>“Too bad,” commented Maynard. “I should
have telephoned first before going to the rehearsal
of the tableaux at the Belasco, to ask you to wait
for me; my stupidity.” He leaned a little nearer.
“Have you seen the taxi-driver?”</p>

<p>“Not yet.” Maynard’s face fell; he had jumped
to the conclusion from Palmer’s manner that he
had news of importance. “The Potomac Taxi
Company reported Sam was engaged to motor a
party out to Camp Meade; they are expected back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
this evening.” Palmer drummed his fingers on the
desk a second, then asked abruptly: “Did you tell
Mrs. Burnham about the attempt to shoot her husband
last night?”</p>

<p>“No.” Maynard balanced his hat on his knee
with nice exactness. “Burnham asked me not to.
And to be quite candid, after I had helped Dr.
Hayden put him to bed I departed and left the
doctor to tell as much as he thought fit to Mrs.
Burnham when she returned.”</p>

<p>“Was she out?”</p>

<p>“Yes, gone to some Red Cross meeting, so Jones
told us.” Maynard smiled broadly. “I rather
imagine from what was said at breakfast this morning
that Mrs. Burnham laid her husband’s condition
to too convivial a disposition.”</p>

<p>Palmer did not smile. “I am afraid she has
frequent occasion to think that and with reason.
Frankly, Maynard, Burnham has been going at a
pretty lively clip during the past six months and
unless he pulls up he will be over the precipice,”
he said soberly.</p>

<p>Maynard’s mirth vanished. “I am sorry to hear
it,” he declared. “Burnham is a good fellow at
bottom, and his wife,” Maynard stooped over to
pick up his hat which had finally over-balanced and
rolled to the floor. There was a pause before he
again spoke. “It must be doubly hard on Mrs. Burnham;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
aside from her affection for her husband she
is a proud woman, and to have her affairs discussed
in public must go against the grain.”</p>

<p>It was Palmer’s turn to smile. “You weren’t
here when their engagement was announced?
Well, my good fellow, Mrs. Burnham was then the
storm-center of criticism, not to say amusement.
No, I can’t believe the public’s opinion, good or
bad, influences her actions. She is a law unto herself.”</p>

<p>Maynard shook his head in unbelief. “What
part of the country does she hail from?” he asked.</p>

<p>“New York; she comes of old Knickerbocker
stock.” Palmer tilted back in his chair. “Her
daughter is like her in looks as well as in disposition;
she also has a will of her own,” he sighed,
then spoke carefully, choosing his words. “I hope
to marry her.”</p>

<p>Maynard looked at him, but his grave manner
precluded jesting. After all there was not so much
difference in Evelyn’s and Palmer’s ages as to
make the match unsuitable. Palmer had money,
influence, and came of a family long distinguished
in his country’s annals. Undoubtedly society’s
verdict would commend such an engagement, and
yet—Maynard’s thoughts reverted to René La
Montague whose aristocratic carriage and good
looks were in vast contrast to the square-jawed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
bulldog type of manhood lolling before him in a
swivel-chair.</p>

<p>“I wish you all success in your courtship,” said
Maynard, suddenly conscious that an answer was
expected of him. “Do Burnham and his wife approve?”</p>

<p>“Burnham does.” Palmer examined his fingernails
critically. “I have never been able to get an
opinion out of Mrs. Burnham; she can be very
evasive when it suits her.”</p>

<p>“Well, the main thing is to win the girl’s affections,”
remarked Maynard. “Don’t worry about
the mother, her opinion is of secondary importance
these days in selecting a husband.”</p>

<p>“Not in this case; Evelyn loses her fortune if she
marries without her mother’s consent.”</p>

<p>“Ah, indeed? And who inherits the fortune in
case Mrs. Burnham’s consent is withheld?”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Burnham.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Maynard stared blankly at the architect.
“An unjust will,” he said gravely. “It is unfair
to Evelyn, very; she has either to marry to please
her mother, or select a wealthy man; or——” He
paused.</p>

<p>“Or what?”</p>

<p>“Choose love in a cottage.”</p>

<p>Palmer shrugged his shoulders. “To a girl
brought up to expect every luxury and never count<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
the cost, love in a cottage hasn’t a great appeal—except
in the movies. I know I shan’t have an
easy time winning Evelyn,” he admitted in a sudden
burst of candor. “She is very popular, but
in the end,” his jaw snapped, “Americans should
marry Americans.”</p>

<p>Maynard’s eyebrows rose slightly; so Palmer
was aware of René La Montagne’s courtship of
Evelyn! Had he gained that information the night
before or was the affair common gossip?</p>

<p>“Heard anything further about the mysterious
dead man?” he inquired.</p>

<p>Palmer looked glum. “Not a thing,” he admitted.
“I called up Coroner Penfield to-day at
Burnham’s request to ask when the inquest would
take place, and was told that a preliminary examination
had been held, the body put in a receiving
vault, and upon further developments the inquest
will be continued.”</p>

<p>Maynard whistled. “The delay is unusual; they
must be waiting for witnesses.”</p>

<p>“Or to identify the dead man.”</p>

<p>“Have they made any progress in solving that
problem?”</p>

<p>“The coroner did not say.”</p>

<p>“Strange that a man can drop out of existence
and not be missed or inquired about,” mused<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
Maynard. “The dead man must have had some
friends or relatives.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they are not in this country.”</p>

<p>“They can always cable.”</p>

<p>Palmer tilted still farther back in his chair.
“Has it occurred to you that the dead man’s friends
or relatives may reside in Germany?”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that the dead man was a German
spy?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Palmer sat upright. “That to me is the
only explanation for the, as you mention, inexplicable
fact that no one has reported such a man
as missing to the police or made inquiries for him.
Coroner Penfield states his photograph has been
circulated with a minute description of his clothes.”</p>

<p>“Has the photograph appeared in the newspapers?”</p>

<p>“I think not. From all accounts he must have
looked pretty gruesome, Maynard; the newspapers
wouldn’t want to publish a picture of a dead man
sitting in a chair. It isn’t done.”</p>

<p>“Pretty good publicity if it were done,” retorted
Maynard bluntly. “Have you told Detective
Mitchell your theory?”</p>

<p>“Not yet.” Palmer hesitated. “Let the police
work out their theories first. There’s another reason,”
and he smiled. “Washington is spy-mad;
and I don’t want to be classed among the men and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
women who write anonymously to the Department
of Justice or telephone the Secret Service regarding
the, to them, suspicious behavior of their neighbors.
Hot air, most of it.”</p>

<p>“Better hot air than run the risk of letting a spy
escape through not reporting him,” remarked
Maynard. “If I were you, Palmer, I wouldn’t
lose any time in seeing Mitchell, and suggest to him
that the Secret Service take a hand in the game.”</p>

<p>“They may be working from that end already,”
answered Palmer doubtfully. “However, if you
think it best I’ll step over to the Treasury Department
and see Chief Connor. Would you like to
come along?”</p>

<p>“Very much.”</p>

<p>“Good.” Palmer swung about and gathered up
the blue prints of all sizes which littered his desk.
He was in the act of placing them in his drawer
when a sharp rap followed instantly by the entrance
of his office boy interrupted him.</p>

<p>“General West is awaitin’ in his car to speak to
yo’,” announced the darkey. “The General’s in a
pow’ful big hurry an’ he wants ter see the plan for
the new buildin’ for the Ordnance.”</p>

<p>Palmer selected four blue prints. “I’ll be right
back,” he told Maynard and hurried out into the
hall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>Left to himself Maynard gazed about the room
and then back at the disorderly desk. Moving
quietly over to it he scanned several drawings and
turned them over. As he did so his eye fell on a
small chess problem diagram half buried among
the larger prints and he picked it up to examine
more closely. With lightning speed his trained
eyes studied the diagram and the message beneath
it:</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_133">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_133.jpg" alt="White to Play and Mate in Two Moves">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption"><span class="smcap">White to Play and Mate in Two Moves.</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A second more and the diagram was tucked
safely in an inner pocket as approaching footsteps
heralded the return of Palmer, and when he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
entered Maynard was indolently reading the evening
newspaper.</p>

<p>“There’s no pleasing some people,” fumed the
architect, tossing the plans he carried into the open
drawer and thrusting the others pell mell on top
of them he slammed the drawer shut and locked
it securely. “We’ve got to hurry, Maynard, to
get to the Treasury Department before closing
time. Come on.”</p>

<p>Stopping only long enough to push down the
safety lock of the door to his private office and
cautioning the boy to take all telephone messages,
Palmer hurried the actor into the street.</p>

<p>“Not a car in sight,” he exclaimed looking up
the street. “We’ll have to walk; all Washington’s
doing it,” he added, laughing, and the two men
strode along, unconsciously quickening their pace
as they crossed Lafayette Square into Pennsylvania
Avenue. Maynard on reaching the north
front of the Treasury swerved toward the long row
of steps leading to the building but Palmer stopped
him.</p>

<p>“Only one entrance used now-a-days,” he explained.
“That on Fifteenth Street, this way,” and
they hurried along Pennsylvania Avenue and
around the corner.</p>

<p>Paying no attention to the sign “No Visitors
Allowed” which hung conspicuously near the only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
open door, Palmer led the way inside the building
and was promptly stopped by an attendant,
whose peremptory manner thawed somewhat at
sight of Palmer’s visiting card.</p>

<p>“I’ll take you to the Captain of the Watch,” he
said. “Here, Tom,” and signing to another attendant
to take his place, he escorted them into a small
room a few steps away. They had to wait until
the Captain of the Watch had interviewed the
three men and two women who had reached the
room ahead of them. At Palmer’s request to see
the Chief of the Secret Service the Captain smiled.</p>

<p>“Won’t an assistant do?” he asked. “The
Chief’s somewhat busy.”</p>

<p>Palmer, having made up his mind to see Chief
Connor, was not to be sidetracked.</p>

<p>“No,” he said decidedly. “I won’t detain the
Chief but a minute; it’s important. Here’s my
card,” and he laid it on the desk. The Captain
pushed over some printed blanks.</p>

<p>“Fill out these forms,” he directed, “both you
and your friend,” and he picked up his telephone
receiver and held a subdued conversation which he
discontinued when Palmer and Maynard handed
him the filled-in blanks bearing their signatures and
addresses. A touch of the push button and the
attendant returned.</p>

<p>“Take these gentlemen upstairs,” the Captain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
directed and turned to interview some newcomers.</p>

<p>As Maynard accompanied Palmer and their
guide up the winding staircase and through the
broad corridors he noted the numerous uniformed
attendants pacing up and down. In the outer
office of the Secret Service Headquarters they were
met by a polite secretary who invited them to be
seated and confide their business to him, which
Palmer, his obstinacy aroused by what his <i>amour
propre</i> took to be a slight in shelving him with a
subordinate when he desired to see the Chief, declined
to do.</p>

<p>The secretary’s patience was wearing thin under
Palmer’s irritating manner and he was about to
close the interview when the swing door leading to
an inner office opened and Detective Mitchell
stepped out. He halted at sight of Maynard, who
sat with his back toward the door, and disappeared
into the room again. An instant later the call bell
buzzed and, excusing himself, the secretary stepped
inside the inner room.</p>

<p>“Nice business keeping a man of my standing
waiting in an anteroom,” fumed Palmer, turning
to Maynard, but the latter’s rejoinder was lost by
the return of the secretary.</p>

<p>“Will you and your friend step this way, Mr.
Palmer?” he said. “Chief Connor will see you.”</p>

<p>Palmer’s walk past the secretary was indicative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
of his feeling of triumph; he had gained his point.
Maynard, following close at his heels, smothered a
smile as they reached the large table near the
window where sat Chief Connor with Detective
Mitchell standing by him.</p>

<p>“Glad to see you, Mr. Palmer,” said Connor
cordially, as Palmer introduced himself and then
mentioned Maynard’s name. Chief Connor rose
and extended his hand to the famous actor.
“Won’t you sit here?” indicating chairs to his right.
“You already know Mitchell, I believe.”</p>

<p>Palmer nodded curtly; he was somewhat taken
aback at the presence of the detective; he would
rather have seen the Chief alone. Maynard, who
had acknowledged Mitchell’s greeting courteously,
waited for Palmer to open the interview, but it was
not until Connor remarked pleasantly: “Well, gentlemen,”
that Palmer addressed him.</p>

<p>“I am convinced that the man found dead in
Burnham’s library on Tuesday afternoon was a
German spy,” he stated. “I presume from the
presence of Detective Mitchell, who is in charge of
the investigation of that mystery, that you are
working along the same lines.”</p>

<p>Connor’s reply took the form of a question.
“What leads you to think the man was a German
spy?”</p>

<p>“The fact that no inquiries have been made for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
him looks to me as if his relatives and friends are
in Germany,” explained Palmer. “If he had been
of any nationality at peace with us, or an American
citizen, his absence would have been reported and
the aid of the police sought.”</p>

<p>Connor nodded slightly. “That is a reasonable
argument, Mr. Palmer, but it is not evidence. Any
one who dies suddenly these days is a German spy—in
the public’s opinion.” The Chief’s stern
mouth relaxed into a faint smile. “We must have
more to go upon than that.”</p>

<p>Maynard looked across at Detective Mitchell.
“Have you identified the man?”</p>

<p>There was a faint pause before Mitchell answered,
“No, but our finger-print experts will
make a final report soon,” he answered.</p>

<p>“Slow work,” observed Palmer, and Chief Connor
saw the color steal up in the detective’s face.</p>

<p>“Slow work—but sure,” he remarked with emphasis.
“Don’t give yourself too much concern,
Mr. Palmer, the police will solve the riddle. And
it is a case presenting some unique features, I’ll
admit.”</p>

<p>“It does,” exclaimed Mitchell eagerly. “Here
we have a man, without an identifying mark on
his person or his clothes, poisoned sometime between
two and three Tuesday morning and his body
not found until twelve hours later, and then located<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
in a room which an hour previous had not contained
his body,” Mitchell rumpled his hair, “and
no one in the house but Miss Evelyn Preston who
arrived that morning. It’s a very pretty problem.”</p>

<p>“There was some one else in the house beside
Miss Preston,” replied Palmer warmly. “The man
who carried the dead body into the library. It’s a
great pity the house wasn’t searched instantly from
top to bottom.”</p>

<p>“True,” agreed Maynard. “But none of us, the
coroner and Dr. Hayden included, realized there
might be a murderer concealed on the premises
until after Penfield’s statement that the man had
been dead about twelve hours, and Miss Preston’s
immediate declaration that some one had rung the
library bell just before she came upstairs from the
kitchen and found the dead man sitting there.
Our search then, of course, proved fruitless; the
man had made good his escape.”</p>

<p>“There wasn’t a trace of any one having been in
the house except Miss Preston,” added Mitchell.
“We searched the entire place.”</p>

<p>“That bears out Burnham’s theory that the man
was murdered elsewhere and carried into his
house,” remarked Palmer.</p>

<p>“It is an interesting theory,” commented Chief
Connor, and turned to Palmer directly. “I understand,
Mr. Palmer, that you are Mr. Burnham’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
most intimate friend; can you tell me if he has any
enemies?”</p>

<p>Palmer glanced involuntarily at Maynard. “I
never heard any one express hatred of Burnham,”
he said, speaking slowly. “But he is not particularly
popular.”</p>

<p>“That bears out what I have heard, Chief,” broke
in Mitchell.</p>

<p>“Yes.” Connor turned again to Palmer. “You
have answered very concisely, Mr. Palmer; now
please tell me if you have heard Burnham express
animosity toward any one.”</p>

<p>Palmer moved restlessly. “That’s a hard question.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because Burnham is very outspoken and frequently
exaggerates his feelings.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Palmer, I will be greatly obliged if you will
answer directly; does Burnham harbor animosity
against any one?”</p>

<p>“Well, to be exact,” Palmer avoided Maynard’s
eyes, “I believe he dislikes René La Montagne.”</p>

<p>“René La Montagne?”</p>

<p>“Captain in the French Flying Corps, an ‘Ace,’”
explained Maynard, breaking into the conversation.
“The dislike is all on Burnham’s side; I have never
heard La Montagne say anything disagreeable about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
Burnham.” He paused, then added, “Burnham’s behavior
is peculiar at times, I understand.”</p>

<p>“So it appears,” replied Chief Connor dryly.
“Mitchell has just informed me that Burnham’s
train reached Washington about one thirty Tuesday
morning.”</p>

<p>“It did?” Palmer sat up and stared at the
speaker. “Why, Burnham telephoned me Tuesday
<i>night</i> from Union Station that he had just arrived.”</p>

<p>Maynard, the fingers of his right hand resting in
his vest pocket, thrust a paper deeper down inside
the lining as he listened absorbedly to the conversation.</p>

<p>“There is another point where you can help us,
Mr. Palmer,” continued Chief Connor. “Has
Burnham in your presence ever uttered seditious
and disloyal sentiments?”</p>

<p>“Never!” Palmer’s denial was instant.</p>

<p>“Ah!” Chief Connor eyed his visitors sharply.
“Your statement contradicts letters received here
in which it is charged that Burnham is a pronounced
pacifist.”</p>

<p>Palmer pushed back his chair and crossed his
legs. “You said seditious utterances,” he began.
“Burnham has never made them before me, but I
have heard him state his pacifist views; that was
before this country went into the war. No one
paid any attention to him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>“One person did,” remarked Connor dryly.
“Our correspondent.”</p>

<p>“And who is he?”</p>

<p>Chief Connor opened a drawer and took from a
file a paper, evidently a deposition as far as Maynard
could make out from where he sat and the
angle at which Connor held the sheet.</p>

<p>“The name signed here,” continued the Chief of
the Secret Service, “is Adolphus Jones.”</p>

<p>“Adolphus Jones,” repeated Palmer. “Who is
he?”</p>

<p>“The Burnhams’ butler—Jones,” answered Detective
Mitchell.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

<small>CONFLICTING CLUES</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FIVE minutes later James Palmer and Dan
Maynard stood on the steps of the Treasury
Department.</p>

<p>“It’s a rum go,” the former remarked. “Who’d
have thought Jones, as old and good a servant as
he is, would have tried to get Burnham into trouble
by reporting him to the Secret Service? It shows
we are all at the mercy of some fool, spy-mad.”</p>

<p>Maynard’s eyes twinkled as he adjusted his tie
which was slightly awry. “It was our German spy
theory regarding the dead man which took us to
see Chief Connor——”</p>

<p>“But we had some ground to go on,” interrupted
Palmer. “Whereas, poor Burnham never uttered
any seditious sentiments, I am confident. That old
fool, Jones, has muddled things nicely.” They
had approached the corner of Pennsylvania Avenue
and Fifteenth Street as they talked and Palmer
stopped at the curb. “Are you going to speak to
Burnham about Jones’ behavior?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not; Chief Connor requested us to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
mention it to no one.” Maynard shot a questioning
look at his companion who stood with one foot in
the street and the other on the curb stone.</p>

<p>“But it seems unfair to Burnham not to warn
him that Jones is a meddlesome, untrustworthy old
fool,” objected Palmer. “After all, Burnham is
our friend.”</p>

<p>“And we can prove our friendship by holding our
tongues,” replied Maynard warmly. “Burnham
seems laboring under a severe nervous strain; it
won’t take much more excitement to break him
down. The Secret Service will weed out the lies;
Jones’ statements about his employer will be taken
for what they are worth; so don’t worry.”</p>

<p>Palmer frowned. “I don’t like it,” he said, shaking
a puzzled head. “However, while I’ll say
nothing about the matter, I’ll keep my eye on Jones.
Are you coming over to the club?”</p>

<p>“Not now.” Maynard glanced up at the clock
tower of the building diagonally across the street
from where they stood. “I have just time to do
several errands before the shops close. I’ll stop
at the club on the way home.”</p>

<p>“All right, be sure and look me up,” and Palmer
dodged an on-coming motor truck and hurried
across the street.</p>

<p>Maynard again consulted the clock in the tower
and then crossed over to a drug store. Entering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
a telephone booth he finally succeeded in getting
the Burlington apartment; the Central there, however,
informed him that Captain René La Montagne
had not returned and had not left word when he
would be in. A telephone call to the Frenchman’s
office elicited no more information. Where in the
devil’s name was La Montagne?</p>

<p>Maynard left the drug store in a disgusted frame
of mind and with the question unanswered. He
had spent the morning trying to find first Palmer
and then La Montagne in between attending the
rehearsals for the Red Cross benefit at the Belasco
Theatre. His offer to take part in the tableaux
had been eagerly accepted and a telephone call before
he left the Burnhams’ had apprised him that
his presence was very much needed at the theater.
He had hoped to find Evelyn and Marian rehearsing
their rôles, but neither had turned up, although
he had waited long after his tableau had been tried
out and thereby missed his luncheon at the Burnhams’!
The thought of luncheon reminded him
that he had been exceedingly rude to Mrs. Burnham,
having, in his absent-mindedness, forgotten to
telephone her that he would not be there for that
meal. Turning on his heel he walked up the street
until he came to a florist; after his errand there was
completed he walked up H Street intending to go
to the club, but on reaching Connecticut Avenue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
he decided to return home and started briskly off
up the Avenue. As he crossed Farragut Square
he heard his name called and glancing around saw
Evelyn Preston sitting on one of the park benches.
He quickened his steps and sat down by her.</p>

<p>“You are just the person I want to see,” he announced.
“Tell me where I can find René La
Montagne. I have tried both his office and his
apartment without success.”</p>

<p>“Then I am afraid I cannot help you,” she said.
“René told me last night that he might be called
out of town for a short time; he said that he could
not be more explicit.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Maynard drew his cane up and down
the gravel path in deep thought. As the silence
lengthened Evelyn stole a glance at him; he was
certainly one of the handsomest men who had ever
been a matinée idol.</p>

<p>“I want to ask you a question,” she began, and
Maynard awoke from his abstraction. “Why did
you and James Palmer come into Marian’s apartment
last night?”</p>

<p>“To call on Mrs. Van Ness.”</p>

<p>“That is the obvious answer.” Evelyn’s color
rose. “Now, don’t be angry,” laying an appealing
hand on his coat sleeve. “Didn’t James Palmer
come up there just to spy on me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>Maynard smiled. “No. Frankly, we did not
know you were there.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” ejaculated Evelyn. “Marian and I
thought perhaps Mr. Burnham had suggested your
calling, not you personally,” coloring warmly as
she remembered her use of the word “spy,”—“but
James Palmer.”</p>

<p>“So you think James Palmer wouldn’t be above
spying?” Maynard twisted about on the bench and
faced her.</p>

<p>Evelyn nodded. “I don’t like him,” she admitted
honestly. “I’ll admit I’m prejudiced, but I couldn’t
think, no matter what happened, any worse of him
than I do. He’s—he’s always under my feet.”</p>

<p>Maynard laughed outright. “And that’s what a
man gets for being devoted to a girl,” he said. “I
declare, Evelyn, you are a trifle discouraging.”</p>

<p>“Don’t make fun of me.” Evelyn looked downcast.
“You don’t know how I have had James
Palmer preached at me by my step-father;” she half
shuddered. “That’s why I didn’t spend the summer
at home. Were you with them all the
evening?”</p>

<p>“With them?—with whom?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Burnham and James Palmer.”</p>

<p>“No, I only joined them at Palmer’s apartment
about nine o’clock or a little later.”</p>

<p>“Then you can depend upon it that Mr. Burnham<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
asked James to call on Marian last night just to
find out if René La Montagne and I were there.”
Evelyn nodded her head wisely. “Marian and I
were right in our conclusions, I am sure.”</p>

<p>“Sorry, but you are wrong,” stated Maynard.
“We called on her on impulse so to speak,” he hesitated;
no mention had been made to Evelyn of the
occurrences in Palmer’s apartment the night before
and he could not be more explicit regarding the
reason for their visit to Marian’s apartment.
“What harm was done by Palmer seeing René calling
on you and Mrs. Van Ness?”</p>

<p>“He told Mother and she has forbidden my visiting
Marian,” Evelyn stamped her pretty foot. “It
was perfectly horrid of James Palmer to go and
make trouble.” Her eyes filled with tears. “I am
sitting here now hoping to see Marian on her way
from the State Department and tell her of Mother’s
edict.”</p>

<p>“It’s a shame!” There was honest indignation
in Maynard’s voice. “Suppose I try and persuade
your mother to reconsider——”</p>

<p>“Would you—could you?” Evelyn was a trifle
incoherent. “Oh, but <i>you</i> can do anything. Do
say a good word for René.”</p>

<p>“I will, indeed,” and Maynard, touched by her
emotion, took her hand in a firm clasp. “I will
aid you in every possible way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>Evelyn smiled through her tears. “Then will
you see that this letter reaches René?”</p>

<p>“I will; to-night if possible.” Maynard placed
the envelope in an inside pocket. “Tell me, Evelyn,
did René appear agitated when he reached
Mrs. Van Ness’ apartment last night?”</p>

<p>“Agitated—no.” Evelyn laughed softly at a
sudden recollection. “Only pleasurably excited,”
she added demurely, and Maynard chuckled.</p>

<p>“Can you tell me why Burnham dislikes René?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“He hasn’t any grounds for disliking him,” retorted
Evelyn loyally. “It is just his natural
cussedness.”</p>

<p>Again Maynard chuckled. “You don’t show any
great fondness for your step-father,” he said, and
Evelyn colored, this time with indignation as unhappy
memories rose.</p>

<p>“Why should I?” she demanded. “He has tried
repeatedly to prejudice Mother against me. Oh,
how could she marry him? She must have remembered
my dear splendid father.”</p>

<p>“There is no accounting for taste, Evelyn.” Maynard
felt himself on delicate ground; widening the
breach between the Burnhams and Evelyn would
be like applying a match to a keg of gunpowder.
“It didn’t strike me that Burnham was such a bad
sort when I first knew him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>“You haven’t got him in the family,” exclaimed
Evelyn shrewdly. “It makes all the difference between
tolerance and active dislike. I wish Mother
wasn’t so under his influence.”</p>

<p>“You think she is?”</p>

<p>“I do. I left her fretting about him because his
temperature had gone up and sending frantically
all over town for Dr. Hayden.”</p>

<p>Maynard looked serious. “Has it occurred to
you, Evelyn, that your step-father is an ill man?
Perhaps his irritability and peculiar behavior is
due to some chronic disorder.”</p>

<p>“I’ll ask Dr. Hayden to give him a liver pill.”
Evelyn declined to take her step-father’s health
seriously. “He used to go out a great deal, now
he sits around the house hour after hour, doing
nothing, or else playing chess; he seems to live for
his chess problems alone.”</p>

<p>“It is an absorbing study,” replied Maynard. “Do
you know the game?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I don’t,” promptly. “One chess player
in the family is quite enough.” Evelyn’s active mind
flew off at a tangent. “You missed a nice row by
not coming home for luncheon.”</p>

<p>“Row!” Maynard looked at her in astonishment.
“I was unpardonably rude not to telephone your
mother that I was detained at the theater and not
to wait luncheon for me, but surely a row——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>“Oh, bless you, the row wasn’t about you,”
Evelyn chuckled. “Dr. Hayden read the riot act
to Mrs. Ward and made her get up; she was malingering,
you know.”</p>

<p>“No, not really?” Maynard was all attention;
he had ceased watching the children playing about
the base of the Farragut monument. “Have you
had a talk with Mrs. Ward since her illness?”</p>

<p>“I only exchanged a few words with her when
I went to inquire how she was,” answered Evelyn.
“Matilda has always been a silent, morose woman,
a good worker, and for all her peculiarities she gets
on well with the servants.”</p>

<p>“Have you had all your servants a long time?”</p>

<p>Evelyn reflected before she answered. “The
chambermaid and mother’s maid and the second
man are new; only came this summer; but Mrs.
Ward has been with us over three years, while
Jones came over ten years ago.”</p>

<p>“Is Jones a trustworthy servant?”</p>

<p>“Well, rather,” Evelyn laughed merrily. “He is
the oddest character. Hasn’t he confided to you
about the Missions and his ‘human derelicts’?”</p>

<p>“His what?”</p>

<p>“Reclaimed souls. A year ago mother got very
much wrought up over the ex-gamblers, ex-thieves,
ex-swindlers—there may have been a few ex-murderers
among his friends, to whom he offered the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
hospitality of our servants’ hall, so she suggested
that the Lord had called him to join a mission, and
now he is entirely happy in his new field. He
levies contributions on us once and so often to help
support it; I shouldn’t be a bit surprised if mother
has to adopt the mission in order to keep Jones.”</p>

<p>“You think he is worth keeping?”</p>

<p>Evelyn looked at Maynard in great surprise.
“Yes, indeed. Jones really is an excellent butler,
and kind and considerate to the other servants. His
eccentricities are growing on him, I’ll admit. He
infuriated my step-father last winter by using religious
mottoes on the icing of cakes and having the
floral decorations made in the shape of crosses.
I rather enjoyed their rows.”</p>

<p>“Oh, so Mr. Burnham and Jones don’t hit it
off?”</p>

<p>“Not very well. But mother really is attached
to Jones and declined to discharge him even after
the birthday dinner—you heard about that?” she
broke off to inquire.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>Evelyn’s eyes danced. “It was Mr. Burnham’s
birthday and mother gave a large party. The cook,
a wonderful cake-maker, was told to make the
birthday cake instead of getting it from Rauscher’s.
Unfortunately she left the icing of the cake
to Jones.” Evelyn paused dramatically. “Jones<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
brought in the cake with the candles all lighted,
and before it was cut the guests examined the
decorations. In the center, done in chocolate, was
the date of the day of the dinner, then Mr. Burnham’s
initials, and right around the cake Jones
had put in large lettering: ‘Prepare to meet thy
God.’</p>

<p>“Mr. Burnham hasn’t any sense of humor,”
added Evelyn. “And he hates to be made ridiculous;
I don’t believe he has ever forgiven Jones
and he is always pestering mother to discharge
him.”</p>

<p>“Does Jones know it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” Evelyn laughed mischievously. “There
is not much love lost between them.”</p>

<p>Maynard lowered his voice. “Is Mr. Burnham a
pacifist, Evelyn?”</p>

<p>“I believe so, but I don’t pay much attention to
his arguments,” she answered. “At one time he
was a pronounced admirer of the Germans’ efficiency,
but that was before we entered the war.”</p>

<p>Maynard thumped the neat pile of gravel he had
raked up with his cane back into place before he
again addressed Evelyn.</p>

<p>“I am wondering,” he began finally, “if you can
recall how Mrs. Ward appeared when you found
her on your doorstep after discovering the dead
man in the library?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>Evelyn wrinkled her brow in thought. “I am
afraid I can’t,” she admitted. “I was in a blue
funk and I just clutched her; I think I would
have clutched almost any one whom I found there—even
the murderer!”</p>

<p>Maynard shot a quick look at her. “There is a
point which has been bothering me a good bit,” he
said slowly. “It occurred to me that perhaps——”
he stopped, to add hastily: “Please treat what I
am about to say as confidential——”</p>

<p>Evelyn nodded. “Certainly, I promise.”</p>

<p>“Did Mrs. Ward have keys to the house?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so; no, come to think of it she must
have given the keys to Jones.” Evelyn rubbed her
forehead. “Mrs. Ward was to close the house at
Chelsea after the servants had left and join them
here.”</p>

<p>Maynard drew out an envelope and pencil and
jotted down several words. “Do you recall, Evelyn,
hearing the front door bell ring while you were
in the library with the dead man?”</p>

<p>Evelyn’s eyes opened. “I didn’t hear any bell—then,”
she stated with positiveness. “But a
thousand bells might have rung and I would never
have heard them in my condition of mind. Oh,
if we only knew who rang the library bell we’d
know who killed the man in the room.”</p>

<p>Maynard did not answer at once. “I imagine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
developments in the case depend upon the identification
of the dead man,” he said. “When that
mystery is solved the other details will follow in
their sequence.”</p>

<p>“Have the police made any headway in establishing
the man’s identity?”</p>

<p>“Apparently none.”</p>

<p>Evelyn hesitated and glanced around. The little
path, where they sat, an off-shoot from the broad
walks encircling Farragut’s statue, was deserted
except for themselves.</p>

<p>“There is something I have wanted to speak to
you about, and then I feared you would think me
silly so I never mentioned it,” Evelyn commenced.
“You recall that all the coroner found in the dead
man’s pockets was a piece of string.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“The string was so odd—like a snake,” she
shuddered. “It sort of twined in and out of the
coroner’s fingers as he stood there, I mean just
before Mrs. Ward fainted, and the string made a
deep impression on me, so much so,” she added
hesitatingly, “that when I saw that piece of string
dangling from your coat sleeve yesterday morning
it looked to me identically the same as that found
in the dead man’s pocket.”</p>

<p>“It did?” Maynard straightened up.</p>

<p>“Yes. I meant to have spoken to you about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
it before, but at first it seemed so absurd.” Evelyn
colored. “Thinking it over I grew more positive
that the strings were alike. You haven’t, by chance,
kept it?” eagerly. “You thrust it in your pocket.”</p>

<p>Maynard searched first one pocket and then the
other. “My Yankee thrift makes me keep odds and
ends,” he said. “Ah, here it is,” pulling it out of
his trousers’ pocket.</p>

<p>Evelyn took the gayly colored piece of twine
almost with repugnance. As it swayed in the gentle
breeze it seemed, as she had said, snaky in appearance.</p>

<p>“Do you think it would help in identifying the
dead man?” she asked. “The original piece, I
mean.”</p>

<p>“Yes, if we knew where he had gotten it and how
it came to be in his pocket,” responded Maynard.
“Perhaps I had better give this piece to the coroner.
Where did you get it?”</p>

<p>“It came off one of my packages, you remember,”
she answered. “You helped me carry the bundles
out of the taxi-cab.”</p>

<p>“That’s so.” Maynard again took out his pencil
and envelope. “Where did you shop that day?”</p>

<p>“Let me see—Woodward and Lothrop’s, Huyler’s;
oh, but what is the use of going on with the
list, the only packages which had come untied were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
some writing paper, a box of candy, and a package
of papers belonging to Marian Van Ness.”</p>

<p>A shadow fell across the envelope and Maynard
looked up from his writing. Marian Van Ness
stood at his elbow.</p>

<p>“I never saw two such absorbed people,” she remarked
as he rose. “I saw you from the sidewalk,
Evelyn, and called to you, then in desperation
walked across the grass. If I am arrested for
trespass by the park policeman you will have to
bail me out.”</p>

<p>“Take my seat,” and Maynard stepped back from
the bench, but Marian shook her head.</p>

<p>“I can’t loiter for I have an appointment at the
hair-dresser’s across the street,” she said. “I am
late now.”</p>

<p>“Wait, Marian, and I’ll go with you, I have so
much to tell you,” Evelyn sprang up and promptly
dropped the string; before she could stoop for it
Maynard had picked it up.</p>

<p>“Shall I keep it or will you?” he asked. He
held the string toward Evelyn but his eyes never
left Marian who looked mildly curious as her glance
fell on the dangling string.</p>

<p>“I’ll take it.” Evelyn opened her bag and dropped
the string inside it. “Was the package of papers
which René carried off by mistake tied with that
piece of string, Marian?” she inquired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>“No.” Marian walked beside Maynard, who
suited his long stride to her shorter step. “When
I gave the package to Captain La Montagne to carry
for me it was secured by a rubber band. Do look
out, Evelyn, or you will be run over,” as the
younger girl, not heeding a speeding automobile,
stepped off the curb. It was some seconds, owing
to the congested traffic, before Maynard guided
them safely across the street. Once on the other
side Marian gave him no opportunity to resume
conversation, but walked rapidly toward an old
residence which had been remodeled and given
over to physicians’ offices and a hair-dresser’s
establishment on the first floor.</p>

<p>“We must hurry,” Marian explained. “Sorry,
good-bye,” and slipping her hand inside Evelyn’s
she hastened toward the shop. At the door, however,
they both drew back to let several people pass
and looking over her shoulder, Marian caught
Maynard staring at her. A wave of color mantled
her cheeks and turning in some confusion she ran
into Dr. Hayden.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” he exclaimed, drawing back.
“I thought you saw me and waited for me to pass.”</p>

<p>“I am very stupid,” she laughed and bit her lip.
“Don’t let me detain you.”</p>

<p>“I only wanted to catch Mr. Maynard, pardon
me,” and the busy physician ran down the steps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
to where Maynard, having seen his beckoning hand,
stood waiting.</p>

<p>“Have you seen Palmer?” asked Hayden.</p>

<p>“Yes.” Maynard pulled his companion toward
the curb where they were out of earshot of passers-by.
“Palmer has been unable to locate the taxi-driver,
Sam.”</p>

<p>Hayden looked worried. “Too bad,” he muttered.
“I saw Burnham this morning and urged
him not to press the charge against Captain La
Montagne until he had time to investigate the
Frenchman’s assertion that Sam, the taxi-driver,
had run out of the apartment and up the stairs
just before he approached.”</p>

<p>“Well, that is reasonable,” commented Maynard.
“I trust Burnham listened to you.”</p>

<p>Hayden waited until several women had passed
out of hearing distance before he answered. “Burnham
will not see reason,” he said. “He has become
obsessed with one idea and he will apparently go
to any lengths to see that Captain La Montagne is
punished for his attack upon him—he calls it a
murderous attack.”</p>

<p>Maynard frowned angrily. “Burnham is a——”
he checked his hasty speech. “It looks as if it was
up to us, doctor, to locate Sam, the taxi-driver,
and wring the truth out of him.”</p>

<p>“That is the size of it,” agreed Hayden. “And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
we won’t find it easy. Remember, if Sam clears
La Montagne of doing the shooting he virtually
proves himself guilty.”</p>

<p>“I see your point,” agreed Maynard. “You
mean——”</p>

<p>“That, unless Sam saw another person leave the
apartment when he was there—and it seems on the
face of it highly improbable that three men should
have dashed away from our door in the space of a
few seconds,” interpolated Hayden, “one of these
two men, Sam or La Montagne, shot Burnham.”</p>

<p>“It was Sam,” declared Maynard with conviction.
“Never La Montagne.”</p>

<p>“I agree with you,” added Hayden. “Patients
are waiting for me in my office, Maynard; after
they go I must see Burnham. In the meantime
will you interview La Montagne and ask him if he
noted anything unusual about the taxi-driver, any
undue haste, signs of horror, fear, or indication
that he carried a revolver, though the last is not
likely.”</p>

<p>“I’ll ask La Montagne,” promised Maynard as
the physician moved away with a farewell nod.</p>

<p>Turning about Maynard continued thoughtfully
up Connecticut Avenue. He had reached the juncture
of M Street and Rhode Island Avenue when
his progress was stopped by passing motors. He
was just about to step off the curb when a taxi-cab<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span> 
turned out of Connecticut Avenue and shot
down M Street, but not before Maynard had a
good view of Sam, the taxi-driver, who had half
turned to address his passenger, Captain René La
Montagne.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

<small>THE CALL</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MAYNARD’S hail was lost in the exhaust
from a nearby automobile and he watched
the taxi-cab bearing René La Montagne
continue down M Street with mixed feelings, then
started at a rapid walk in the direction the cab
was going. At Seventeenth Street he saw an empty
car, bearing the placard “For hire,” coming
toward him and promptly stopped the chauffeur.</p>

<p>“See if you can catch up with that car ahead,”
he directed, pointing to La Montagne’s taxi which
could just be seen, and sprang into the automobile.
But the chauffeur, evidently one of the many inexperienced
men who had joined the great army
of licensed motorists to supply the public need of
vehicles, had stalled his engine and when the car
finally started down M Street La Montagne’s taxi
was nowhere in sight.</p>

<p>As they whirled around Thomas Circle Maynard,
who had vented his feelings by swearing a blue
streak under his breath at each second’s delay,
called to the chauffeur to go to the Burlington<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
apartment, and the man changed his direction with
such precipitancy that Maynard was thrown forward.
He had just regained his equilibrium as the
car turned into the driveway leading to the apartment-hotel.</p>

<p>“Has Captain La Montagne returned?” he asked
the doorman.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, just arrived,” and the man touched
his cap respectfully. “Wish to see him, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Maynard paused in getting out of his
car and scanned the numerous motors parked along
the curbing. “Is Captain La Montagne’s taxi waiting
for him?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. The chauffeur picked up a party just
leaving when the Captain said he shouldn’t want
him again to-day, and drove off.”</p>

<p>Maynard stared blankly at the doorman. Should
he go in and see La Montagne or try and locate
Sam, the taxi-driver, first? His inclination was for
the latter course.</p>

<p>“Which way did the taxi go?” he asked.</p>

<p>“’Deed I didn’t notice, sir.” The doorman was too
respectful to show the surprise he felt at the continued
questioning. “Another car drove up and I
went to open the door for the ladies in it. Do you
wish to get out, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” and the servant swung back the door of
his car. “Wait,” called Maynard over his shoulder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
to his chauffeur and entered the building. Not
troubling to have his name telephoned up he
hastened to the elevator and told the boy to take
him to La Montagne’s apartment. His ring at the
bell of the apartment was answered by La Montagne
whose face lighted at sight of his visitor.</p>

<p>“Most welcome,” exclaimed the Frenchman.
“Come right in,” and he led the way across the tiny
entrance hall in the room which, with a bed in an
alcove, did for sitting room and bedroom. La
Montagne dragged forward a chair and perched
himself on the only other one the room boasted and
then addressed Maynard in his own language.</p>

<p>“We are old friends; let us talk at ease,” he
began. “Who is James Palmer?”</p>

<p>“A Washington architect,” was Maynard’s concise
reply.</p>

<p>“Of independent means?”</p>

<p>“I understand he is quite wealthy, but I really
know very little about the man. Why are you inquiring
about him, René?” and Maynard looked at
his companion with quickened interest.</p>

<p>“Because,” explained La Montagne frankly. “I
have puzzled much over the scene before the door
of Mr. Palmer’s apartment last night. Why did
you and he show such interest in my simple action
of stopping to inquire the way to Madame Van
Ness’ apartment?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>Maynard studied the Frenchman as he considered
the question. It was surely only fair to
answer it; La Montagne could not defend himself
until informed of the charges against him—after
all, what were they? His appearance at the door
of Palmer’s apartment immediately following the
attempted assassination of Burnham could be a
coincidence only; stranger things than that had
happened in Maynard’s experience. After all the
most serious phase of the affair was Burnham’s
half delirious statement that La Montagne had
“tried to get him.” A man making a charge had
to prove it; therefore, it was up to Burnham to
substantiate his statement with evidence, and La
Montague’s assertion that he had seen the taxi-driver
leave the apartment a second before he
himself reached the door was possible of confirmation
as soon as he located the chauffeur. As it
stood, both Burnham and La Montagne had made
unsupported statements—and each man’s word was
as good as the other’s until proved a liar.</p>

<p>“Some one took a pot shot at Burnham as we sat
in Palmer’s apartment,” stated Maynard slowly.
“The shot was evidently fired from the balcony
into the room.”</p>

<p>La Montagne straightened up and gazed intently
at Maynard. “Yes, continue——” he urged.</p>

<p>“Access to the balcony is from the hall of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
apartment; there was time, René, for an active man
to have slipped back from the balcony into the
corridor after having fired the shot and been standing
just where we found you when we rushed into
the hall.” Maynard checked off his remarks on his
fingers. “The long French window which gives
admittance from the hall to the balcony was open
as well as the outer door leading from the apartment
to the corridor where you stood.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, what then? Just because I stopped
before a strange door does not mean I am a
criminal!” La Montagne jerked out his sentences.
“Even in this mad America!”</p>

<p>Maynard was silent for a second. “Burnham
fainted from excitement,” he said. “However, he
caught a glimpse of you before Palmer closed the
door and called out that you had ‘tried to kill
him’.”</p>

<p>La Montagne gazed at Maynard in blank astonishment.
“<i>Mon Dieu!</i> Is the man possessed?”</p>

<p>“It would seem so,” agreed Maynard. “But I
think another word fits the case better, ‘obsessed’,”
and as the Frenchman looked puzzled, he added,
“Burnham appears to hate you.”</p>

<p>“Hate me!” La Montagne threw himself back
in his chair. “Everywhere I hear of such animosity
on his part, and why?” he laughed vexedly. “It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
is a German trait to ‘<i>strafe</i>’ and not an American
characteristic.”</p>

<p>Maynard stopped fingering his wrist watch and
stared at his companion. “You mean the animosity
is all on his side?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely. Our intercourse has been little but
friendly——”</p>

<p>“But—but you know he opposes your engagement
to Evelyn——?”</p>

<p>“So I have understood recently.” La Montagne
shot a questioning look at Maynard. “Are you trying
to establish a motive for my so-called attempt
to shoot Burnham?”</p>

<p>“Frankly, yes. Now, keep calm, René; this
thing has got to be thrashed out in sober earnest
and if Burnham is determined to involve you in the
attempted shooting, it is up to us to prove him a
liar,” continued Maynard. “We can only do that
by discussing the matter at every angle.”</p>

<p>“True,” admitted the Frenchman, but his hot
color had not gone down, although his manner was
more tranquil. “Aside from all else there is one
point which establishes my innocence.”</p>

<p>“What is that? The presence of the taxi-driver?”</p>

<p>“<i>Non, non!</i> If I had shot at Burnham I would
have killed him! See——” touching one of his medals
which he wore. “It is for marksmanship. If you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
do not believe——” His hand sought his desk drawer
and he whipped out his revolver—the tinkle of the
shattered glass of the small incandescent electric
light bulb, one of a cluster of imitation candles in
the hall, broke the tense silence. “<i>Voilà!</i>”</p>

<p>Maynard sprang to his feet, his eyes glued to
the automatic pistol. “Good God! You have a
Maxim silencer on your gun!”</p>

<p>“But yes,” responded La Montague composedly.</p>

<p>“But, but——?” Maynard’s words tumbled over
themselves. “It is forbidden by law to put a
Maxim silencer on any weapon.”</p>

<p>“Laws are broken daily in America, <i>mon ami</i>;
why so excited over trifles?”</p>

<p>“Trifles!” Maynard ruffled his hair. “René, the
man who shot at Burnham used a revolver or pistol
with a Maxim silencer on it.”</p>

<p>“<i>Eh bien!</i> What then?”</p>

<p>“This,” tersely. “You have an automatic equipped
with a Maxim silencer; you were standing within
a few yards of where the shooting took place—the
door and window both open; and your engagement
to Evelyn is opposed by her step-father.” Maynard
drew a long breath. “There you are; weapon,
presence, motive.”</p>

<p>“Bah!” La Montague’s scornful laugh was
short. “You forget the presence of the taxi-driver<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
whom I saw depart from the apartment before I
reached the door.”</p>

<p>“Who is going to confirm your statement that
he was there?”</p>

<p>“Why, the taxi-driver.”</p>

<p>Maynard shrugged his shoulders. “Do you
think he is going to convict himself to clear you?”</p>

<p>“You mean——?”</p>

<p>“I mean you are going to have some difficulty in
clearing yourself of having taken a pot shot at
Burnham when you found the opportunity open
to you, because”—Maynard spoke impressively—“if
you did not attempt to shoot Burnham, the taxi-driver
is the only other person who could have
shot at him, and he is hardly likely to incriminate
himself.”</p>

<p>La Montagne listened with ever growing impatience
and increasing anger.</p>

<p>“You—you——” he stammered. “You call yourself my friend,
and yet you tell me to my face that
my word is not as good as a common chauffeur’s!
I tell you I saw the man leave the apartment just
before I got there. Enough—good-bye.”</p>

<p>But Maynard did not rise though the Frenchman
stepped menacingly toward him.</p>

<p>“I said in the commencement, René, that we
had to discuss this affair from every angle,” he
began. “Be reasonable and sit down.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>Instead of complying, the Frenchman tramped
excitedly up and down the room.</p>

<p>“What is your next angle?” he demanded.
“More insults?”</p>

<p>“No, René; the taxi-driver——”</p>

<p>“To be sure, the taxi-driver. Have you talked
with him?”</p>

<p>“Not yet.”</p>

<p>“No? Ah, you would rather come and insult
me; you could not go on my simple word and
arrest him as the murderer, but you think me
guilty!” La Montagne, gesticulating wildly, moved
about the room as if on springs.</p>

<p>“For heaven’s sake sit down and keep quiet,”
begged Maynard. “I tried to see the taxi-driver,
Sam, but he was with you——”</p>

<p>“With me?” La Montagne stepped back,
astounded.</p>

<p>“Yes; I saw him driving your car and chased
after you, hoping to see you together,” explained
Maynard. “Did you question him?”</p>

<p>“I? <i>Mon Dieu, non!</i>” La Montagne’s eyes were
twice their usual size. “I did not recognize the man—but
now you speak of it”—he checked himself
and continued his nervous walk about the apartment.
Suddenly he stopped and turned to his
silent companion. “Let us go and talk with the
chauffeur,” he suggested briskly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>Maynard looked at his watch. “Perhaps we will
find him at his garage,” he said. “He should be
back by this time, especially as the manager of the
garage told Palmer he had taken a party to Camp
Meade and back.”</p>

<p>“I was the party.” La Montagne paused to lock
his desk and bolt the windows, then he picked up
his cap. “<i>En avant, mon ami!</i>” he exclaimed, his
anger a thing of the past. “We will prove Burnham
a liar, we two, and Evelyn shall be my bride
before many days.”</p>

<p>“Evelyn!” Maynard clapped his hand into his
pocket as her name recalled her message. “Evelyn
gave me a letter for you.”</p>

<p>“Give it here.” In his eagerness La Montagne
almost snatched the letter from Maynard and left
the closing of the door of his apartment to him
as he moved down the corridor reading the letter.
Maynard was about to follow when his glance
happened to fall on the outer wall of La Montagne’s
apartment and he saw a flattened bullet slightly
projecting from it. Taking out his penknife he
pried the bullet out of the lath and plaster and
slipping it inside his pocket, he joined La Montagne
at the elevator shaft.</p>

<p>“I know something of firearms,” he said, lowering
his voice although they had the corridor to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
themselves. “Your automatic is loaded with reduced
charges.”</p>

<p>“And why not?” La Montagne raised his eyebrows.
“It will still kill a man!”</p>

<p>“René,” Maynard’s manner grew stern. “Your
conduct bears but one interpretation—you go armed
because you fear an attack.”</p>

<p>La Montague’s smile was enigmatic. “Life is
held very cheap in war-time,” he remarked, and
stepped forward as the crowded elevator stopped
at their floor. “Enter.”</p>

<p>It was not until they were inside the closed taxi
and the car speeding on its way to the Potomac
garage that La Montagne addressed his equally
silent companion.</p>

<p>“Evelyn writes that her mother is much incensed
that I met her as she states, clandestinely, and forbids
that she go again to stay with Madame Van
Ness,” he said. “It is unfair—unjust! Next
time——” His mouth closed like a steel trap. “I begin
to think like Madame Van Ness.”</p>

<p>Maynard looked at him keenly. “What do you
mean?”</p>

<p>“Madame Van Ness told me Wednesday afternoon
that Mr. and Mrs. Burnham both disliked me;
for what I know not, but she suggested——”</p>

<p>“Yes, go on!” There was subdued eagerness in
Maynard’s tone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>“She suggested that while Mrs. Burnham’s prejudice
against me might be prompted by her
husband, his dislike was traceable to an event in
Paris. But it hardly seems possible,” he broke off
to add.</p>

<p>“Oh, go on, man; I can judge better perhaps than
you.”</p>

<p>“Burnham had his face slapped by André de
Sartiges at the club in Paris; he did not challenge,
as is the French custom.” Maynard, drinking in
what he said, nodded comprehension. “Later Burnham
cut short his visit in Paris, or so I heard afterward;
I was but a spectator at the quarrel in the
club; in fact the scene was ridiculously funny and
I laughed.”</p>

<p>Back to Maynard’s memory came Evelyn’s
words: “Mr. Burnham hates to be made ridiculous.”</p>

<p>“Hump! It looks as if your sense of humor had
cost you a bride,” he remarked dryly. “Burnham
has apparently brooded over your untimely mirth
until he has exaggerated it into a capital offense.”</p>

<p>“But then he is of unbalanced mind!” exclaimed
La Montagne, astonished. “To think of a laugh
seven years old and charge me with an attempt to
kill because of it—<i>Mon Dieu!</i>” He shook his head.
“Are such things possible? But yet Madame Van
Ness believes Burnham’s enmity is of the past, and
she is discerning.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>“You have discussed the matter with her?”
Something odd in Maynard’s tone caused the
Frenchman to glance at him quickly, but his face
was expressionless.</p>

<p>“But yes, she is Evelyn’s best friend,” La Montagne
answered simply. “She has been most kind
in aiding me to set straight certain misunderstandings
with Evelyn. She has a most sympathetic
nature. You like her, <i>n’est ce pas</i>?”</p>

<p>“Yes, oh, yes.” Maynard drew out his cigarette
case and offered it to his companion. “Have one?”</p>

<p>There was silence as the Frenchman busied himself
in striking a match which he first held against
Maynard’s cigarette before lighting his own.</p>

<p>“She is very beautiful, that Madame Van Ness,”
pursued La Montagne. “Is she a divorcée or a
widow?”</p>

<p>Maynard, gazing into the street, saw that their
chauffeur was passing the Potomac Garage instead
of stopping and tapped upon the plate glass partition
and signed to the chauffeur to pull up at the
curb.</p>

<p>“What did you say, René?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Is Madame Van Ness a divorcée or a widow?”</p>

<p>“There is no Mr. Van Ness—here we are; come
on,” and opening the door he sprang to the sidewalk,
followed by the Frenchman. A man, evidently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
the foreman from his manner and dress, sauntered
up and Maynard spoke to him.</p>

<p>“Is there a chauffeur named Sam employed here?
He drives frequently for Mr. James Palmer,” he
added by way of explanation, as he saw the foreman
looked dubious.</p>

<p>“Oh, aye.” Ferguson turned and called to a
helper lounging near the entrance. “Tell Dutch
to come here,” and the man threw down his tools
and ran in the building. The foreman turned back
to Maynard. “Dropped anything in his car?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>Further conversation was cut short by the
appearance of Sam, still carrying the waste he had
been busily wiping his hands on when sent for. A
streak of black grease showed plainly where he had
pushed his red hair off his forehead.</p>

<p>“What’s wanted, Boss?” he asked. Ferguson
with a jerk of his thumb indicated Maynard and
the chauffeur looked at him and bobbed his head
in recognition. Ferguson, mildly curious, propped
himself against a lamp-post and prepared to listen
to the interview, but the arrival of several taxi-cabs
called him away to his duties.</p>

<p>Maynard waited an appreciable moment for La
Montagne to speak, but as the Frenchman said nothing,
he addressed the waiting taxi-driver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>“You were in the Bellevue apartment house last
night between nine and ten o’clock——” It was an
assertion, but Sam took it as a question and answered
briskly.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; I went there to take Colonel Jean,”
Sam’s pronunciation was somewhat faulty, “to
the train. He kept me waiting so long we ’most
missed it.”</p>

<p>“Why did you stop at Mr. Palmer’s apartment
on your way to the Colonel’s rooms?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t stop, Boss,” quickly. “I went up in the
elevator without getting off until I struck the
Colonel’s floor. I wasn’t near Mr. Palmer’s apartment.”
Sam’s eyes never flickered under Maynard’s
level gaze.</p>

<p>There was a brief silence, then La Montagne,
who had been studying Sam with eager intentness,
shook his head.</p>

<p>“He is of similar build and height, and his
clothes the same as the man I saw leave Mr.
Palmer’s apartment,” he said. “But I cannot swear
to his identity.”</p>

<p>“You cannot!” Maynard stared aghast at him.</p>

<p>“No.” La Montagne looked hard at Sam, who
gazed back at him unmoved. “No, I did not see
the taxi-driver’s face.”</p>

<small>THE BLOTTED PAGE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MARIAN Van Ness turned the latch-key
and stepped into her apartment with reluctance.
After her visit to the hairdresser
she had persuaded Evelyn, against the latter’s
better judgment, to take a light dinner down
town with her and had prolonged the walk home
because of her desire for companionship. It was
Mammy’s “church night,” and Marian dreaded the
long evening by herself before the return of the
faithful old servant who had been her mother’s
personal maid years before. Mammy was a privileged
character, and her shrewd comments and
homely maxims frequently wiled away the tedium
of evenings at home.</p>

<p>When Marian felt the strain of over-work and
long hours at the State Department Mammy, on
her return, would put her to bed and nurse her as
she had done in infancy. Her large black hand
possessed a magic touch healing, in its soothing
influence, every tortured nerve and bringing sleep
in its train. She would have made her fortune as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
a masseuse, but loyalty to her “chile” kept her in
devoted attendance, sharing Marian’s varying vicissitudes
with fortifying courage.</p>

<p>Marian’s light footfall made no sound as she
crossed the tiny dining room on her way to the
kitchenette opening from it. A peep inside disclosed
Mammy dozing in a comfortable arm
wicker chair. Marian’s surprised ejaculation
awoke her.</p>

<p>“Laws! Honey,” she ejaculated, straightening her
white turban. “Yo’ am late to-night; jes’ take yo’
tings off an’ Mammy’ll hab supper in a jiffy.”</p>

<p>“Don’t trouble, Mammy, I had my dinner down
town.” Marian looked up at the kitchen clock. “You
are late, dear; hurry and get your things on.”</p>

<p>“I isn’t goin’ to church dis evenin’, Honey.”</p>

<p>“You are not!” Marian’s surprise increased;
for Mammy to miss her weekly devotional was almost
unheard of. “Aren’t you well?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I’se well, but I’se tired,” Mammy
sighed as she reached across to a corner and pulled
forward an electric vacuum cleaner. “I’se been a
wrestlin’ wif dis hyar contraption ’most all day.
’Taint any use ob talkin’, Honey, de store-man
cheated yo’, fo’ dis hyar cleanin’ machine ain’t no
good, de vaccium’s done gone out ob it.”</p>

<p>Marian concealed her amusement from the tender
old eyes watching her. “I’m afraid, Mammy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
you are too addicted to dusters and brooms,” she
remarked.</p>

<p>“’Deed I ’spects dat’s so, Honey; an’ ole broom
knows whar de dust is.” Mammy followed Marian
into the parlor. “Yo’se lookin’ kinder peaked,
Honey; is dey aworkin’ yo’ as hard as ebber?”</p>

<p>“Every one works hard these days, Mammy.”
Marian handed her hat and gloves to the servant
and threw herself on the sofa which stood in front
of the window. “I’ll just sit here and rest a bit.
You go to bed, Mammy, and don’t worry over this
apartment; it is the most spotlessly clean place in
town.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Honey.” Mammy carried Marian’s belongings
into her bedroom and returned with a light
weight summer afghan which she spread over Marian,
who had curled up in a corner of the sofa and
was lying back with closed eyes. She did not stir
and Mammy, with a final pat, stole from the room
and went back to her quarters, there to doze in
comfort.</p>

<p>Marian lay quietly on the sofa for more than
an hour, and when she sat up darkness had succeeded
the twilight. Too tired to move, she leaned
back and propped her elbow on the window ledge
and looked out. The view was more attractive
than that generally seen from back windows; the
rows of neat back yards, however, were devoid of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
light and the houses they belonged to were also
lightless except the Burnham mansion.</p>

<p>From where she sat Marian could see that lights
burned in the octagon-shaped wing of the mansion
on several of its floors, and her familiarity with the
house’s architectural arrangements enabled her to
locate the different rooms. Mrs. Burnham had
neglected to pull down the shades in her boudoir
and Marian saw her knitting by the aid of a
movable standing electric lamp, while Peter Burnham,
sitting before the desk, was examining some
papers. In the room above only a faint light glowed
and Marian wondered if the housekeeper, Mrs.
Ward, had left her bedroom and resumed her
duties.</p>

<p>Marian’s eyes traveled downward to the open
windows of Evelyn Preston’s bedroom, but they
were dark; evidently Evelyn was either lying down
or had gone to another part of the house. Even
as she looked a light flashed in Evelyn’s room and
in the sudden illumination she had an excellent
view of the white walls of her friend’s room.
Even as she watched Evelyn crossed before the
windows and a second later the light was switched
off. For many minutes thereafter Marian sat in
darkness.</p>

<p>The front door bell sounded with such sharp
suddenness that Marian started up in alarm.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
Throwing the afghan aside and switching on the
electricity she hurried to the door before Mammy,
whose doze had developed into heavy slumber, could
pull herself out of her chair. A trusted State
Department messenger stepped inside the entrance
hall and handed Marian a sealed envelope.</p>

<p>“I was instructed to wait,” he explained, and took
a chair just inside the parlor.</p>

<p>First stopping to pull down her window shades
Marian hurried to her desk, and, taking the pages
from the envelope, she proceeded to decode the
messages written thereon. She had almost completed
the task when, on starting a fresh page, her
fountain pen commenced to leak and sent a stream
of ink across her writing. With an impatient exclamation
she picked up a fresh piece of blotting
paper and checked the flow of ink, then continued
the decoding. When her work was completed she
gathered up the dispatches and the original messages
and, placing them in a large envelope, carefully
sealed the package with red wax and a ring bearing
her crest.</p>

<p>The messenger, who had alternately read the
evening paper and several magazines to occupy his
time, rose with alacrity at her approach. Taking
the envelope he buttoned it securely in an inner
pocket of his coat.</p>

<p>“Rush work to-night,” he said. “They sent me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
here in a taxi-cab so that if I didn’t find you in I
could locate you elsewhere.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you telephone beforehand?”</p>

<p>“Central reported your ’phone out of order,” he
smiled. “Ain’t it fierce? Good-night,” and opening
the door he stepped outside and almost on top
of Dan Maynard whose hand, outstretched to ring
the bell, struck him sharply on the chest. With a
muttered word of apology the messenger hastened
toward the elevator and left Marian and Maynard
facing each other.</p>

<p>“May I come in?” he asked. His voice was very
winning and there was a certain wistful appeal in
his eyes as they met hers which possibly accounted
for the sudden color in her cheeks. She stood in
doubt for a brief second, then stepped back to
admit him.</p>

<p>“I won’t take up much of your time,” he commenced,
laying his hat down on the desk and turning
to face her as she stopped in the middle of the
parlor. “I have a message from René La Montagne.
It is rather long——” He glanced about and then
back at her.</p>

<p>“Then suppose we sit down.” Marian was regaining
her old poise. Moving over to the sofa she
ensconced herself on one end of it as Maynard
pulled forward a chair. “You look”—staring at
him steadily—“a trifle weary.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>“I am.” Maynard pushed back his short hair
from his temples. “These are strenuous days;” his
manner grew more earnest as he bent forward.
“Now for my message; René desires to know if
you will accompany Evelyn to Rockville, Maryland,
next Tuesday.” She looked at him inquiringly and
he added, “René plans to marry Evelyn there.”</p>

<p>She did not answer immediately. “Can René
secure a license?” she asked finally.</p>

<p>“Yes.” His penetrating gaze never wavered as
he studied her. “You will help them?”</p>

<p>“I will.”</p>

<p>Maynard lowered his voice. “Do you quite
realize what your promise implies?” he asked
anxiously. “The Burnhams will bitterly resent
your part in Evelyn’s marriage, and they are in
a position to make things most unpleasant for you.”</p>

<p>“Are they?” Marian’s back stiffened. “I am not
afraid of the Burnhams or—any one.”</p>

<p>Maynard sat back and glanced away from her.
“Then you are fully determined to assist Evelyn
and René to elope?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I am.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Why?” Marian eyed him in surprise, “Because
of my affection for Evelyn.”</p>

<p>“You think, then, a hasty marriage is wise?”</p>

<p>Marian’s fingers played with the afghan. “Circumstances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
alter cases,” she said composedly. “Evelyn
and René are very much in love and deserve
their happiness.”</p>

<p>Maynard again leaned nearer. “You have so
much sympathy for another’s romance and for
your own you have none. Do you never think of
yourself?”</p>

<p>“Too much.” Marian’s smile was strained. “I
would rather you left my feelings and my affairs
out of the discussion.”</p>

<p>“Certainly; but——” Maynard hesitated a long
moment. “Your husband——”</p>

<p>“Died long ago.”</p>

<p>Both her voice and manner precluded further
questioning, and biting his lip Maynard sat back
and contemplated her in silence. A deeper appreciation
of her beauty stirred his pulse to a quicker
beat; anxiety and hard work, which embitters some
natures, had softened and rounded out Marian’s
character. Maynard was unaware of the passing
seconds as he sat musing, and Marian, controlling
her restless longing to be alone, sat like an image,
thankful that she had a back to lean against and
the side of the sofa on which to rest her elbow.
She felt inexplicably weary. Why would Maynard
persist in raising the specter of the past? How
could he allude to——</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>A loud ring of the bell came as a welcome relief
to Marian.</p>

<p>Before she could start to answer it old Mammy
appeared in the entrance hall from the dining room,
having gone there upon awakening to find out whose
voice it was she heard talking to Marian. The
next instant she had ushered James Palmer into
the parlor.</p>

<p>“Don’t get up, Mrs. Van Ness,” he entreated,
moving forward with as much speed as his bulk
permitted. “I only stopped in for a moment. Don’t
think me unneighborly if I confess I came to see
Maynard,” laying his hand on the latter’s shoulder.</p>

<p>Marian laughed vexedly. Did every one in the
apartment house keep tab on her visitors, or was it
only Palmer’s curiosity which had brought him
there to find out if by chance Evelyn and her
French lover were with her? Palmer’s next remark
to Maynard caught her by surprise in its
direct answer to her unspoken question.</p>

<p>“The elevator boy, Jim, told me you were looking
at the vacant apartment next to this, Maynard,
and he had seen you afterward stop at Mrs. Van
Ness’ door, so,” added Palmer, “I took the chance
of finding you here.”</p>

<p>“Do you wish anything, Palmer?” Maynard rose
reluctantly; he had hoped to prolong his <i>tête-à-tête</i>
with Marian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>“It is nothing so very important,” replied Palmer.
“Peter Burnham has telephoned several times to
ask if you were with me; he wants you to play
chess with him. I tried to locate you in several
places, as I judged from Burnham’s voice that he
was getting excited and I thought a game with you
might quiet him down.”</p>

<p>“We can try it.” Maynard, picking up his hat,
inadvertently knocked several papers from the
desk. Picking them up he laid them with the red
blotter back on the desk, and then he turned to
Marian and held out his hand.</p>

<p>She shook it with perfunctory courtesy. “Do I
understand you have taken the next apartment?”
she asked and there was a catch in her throat which
Palmer was quick to detect.</p>

<p>“I plan to.” Maynard preceded Palmer to the
door. “You will find me a quiet neighbor. Good
night.”</p>

<p>Palmer, following Maynard closely, was surprised
at the speed with which the door was closed behind
him, almost upon his back in fact. He was about
to comment upon it, but his companion’s preoccupied
expression and air induced him to remain
silent.</p>

<p>Mammy, who had shut the door with such precipitancy,
leaned against its panels and looked with
staring eyes at Marian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>“I’se recognized him now, Honey,” she gasped.
“At las’ I’se recognized him, I mean his voice——”</p>

<p>“Stop!” Marian laid a warning finger on the
old woman’s trembling lips. “We mustn’t tell all
we know. Come and help me get to bed. I am
tired, oh, so tired,” and to Mammy’s consternation
she burst into violent weeping as she ran into her
bedroom.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>One—two—three—chimed the clock on the mantel
in Marian’s parlor and the sound drowned the
faint noise made by the turning of the lock of the
front door; the next instant the door opened and
a figure slipped in, listened a moment, then slipped
with incredible swiftness into the parlor. A second
later a flashlight played over the furniture, never
ceasing in its rapid movement until the rays of light
disclosed the scrap-basket. The intruder turned
over its contents, then the basket was replaced,
and once again the flashlight played about the
parlor, to linger longest on the desk.</p>

<p>Underneath a pile of correspondence lay a
piece of red blotting paper. The intruder picked
it up; a few words were discernible on its almost
unused surface. With a soft sigh of thankfulness
the intruder pocketed the blotter and silently stole
from the apartment.</p>

<small>BURNHAM PREFERS CHARGES</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MRS. WARD, going about her work languidly,
distracted Jones from his usual duties;
he was not quite certain what was expected
of him, to attend to the housekeeper’s whims
or to valet Peter Burnham whose continued indisposition
had developed a fondness for being waited
on. The butler searched in vain for Mrs. Burnham
to ask for orders, but the only person he located
on the second floor was Evelyn Preston.</p>

<p>“Indeed, Miss Evelyn,” he protested, “what am
I to do? Mrs. Burnham says Mr. Burnham is to
stay abed, and Mr. Burnham says he wants his
clothes, and Mrs. Ward comes along and says I am
to pack Mr. Maynard’s bag.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Maynard’s bag!” Evelyn sat down in the
hall chair. “What are you talking about, Jones?”</p>

<p>“I don’t rightly know, Miss; I’ve moved Mr.
Maynard’s things from the room upstairs to the
spare bedroom on this floor ’cause Mrs. Ward said
it was too hot for him up there; that was yesterday,
and now——” Jones wagged his head despondently.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
“A body can’t obey everybody,” he grumbled. “I’d
best be accepting the Mission’s offer——”</p>

<p>“Now, Jones, don’t talk nonsense,” interrupted
Evelyn firmly. “The person to be obeyed in this
house is——”</p>

<p>“Who, Miss? That’s just what I want to know,”
blurted out Jones as she hesitated.</p>

<p>“Why—why, Mother.” Evelyn regretted the words
the moment she had spoken; whatever her private
opinion of the extent or limitation of her step-father’s
authority it should not have found expression
before a servant. “Mother is the proper person
for you to go to to settle that question,” she
added in haste.</p>

<p>“Where can I find Mrs. Burnham?” asked Jones.</p>

<p>Evelyn paused to reflect; where had she last seen
her mother?</p>

<p>“I think she went down into the basement,” she
said uncertainly. “Or did she go to the garret?”</p>

<p>Jones concealed a smile behind a discreet cough.
“Never mind, Miss Evelyn, I’ll keep going until I
find her,” he said as he moved off.</p>

<p>“Wait, Jones,” and the butler halted. “Has Mr.
Maynard gone out?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss, about an hour ago; anything else,
Miss?”</p>

<p>“No, that is all, thank you,” and the servant
went down stairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>Left to herself Evelyn stared reflectively down
the hall. Was Dan Maynard really leaving? He
had said nothing to her at the breakfast table about
going; surely he would keep his word and help——
The sound of an opening door made her look around
just as Mrs. Ward stepped out of the library. At
Evelyn’s call she turned with reluctance, or so it
seemed to Evelyn, and approached her.</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss Evelyn,” she said, and stood waiting
respectfully.</p>

<p>“Did Mr. Maynard mention at what hour he
would return when he gave directions to have his
bag packed?” asked Evelyn.</p>

<p>“No, Miss.” The housekeeper’s voice, monotonous
in tone, always grated on Evelyn’s ear. She
scanned the woman attentively; Mrs. Ward certainly
had more lines in her face, and her hair, already
gray, had gained an added whiteness in the past
few days, which, contrasted with her sallow skin,
made her look for the first time old in Evelyn’s
eyes. Mrs. Ward moved restlessly under her continued
staring, and her severe mouth tightened as
she pressed her lips more firmly together.</p>

<p>“Is there anything else, Miss Evelyn?” she inquired
finally.</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” but as the housekeeper turned
to leave, Evelyn asked, “Why did you go in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
library, Mrs. Ward? The coroner has forbidden
any one entering it.”</p>

<p>Not stopping her rapid walk Mrs. Ward looked
back over her shoulder and answered none too
civilly: “I went in to straighten the room. Your
mother told me to; therefore the responsibility is
hers.”</p>

<p>Without comment Evelyn watched the housekeeper’s
tall spare form disappear toward the back
stairs, then she moved thoughtfully over to the
library door and turned the knob—only to find the
door locked. Evelyn stared at the closed door in a
brown study. She recalled distinctly seeing the
housekeeper step into the hall and she had most
certainly not stopped to lock the door behind her.
The lock was like the others in use throughout the
house, not a spring catch but one which had to be
turned by a key.</p>

<p>On sudden impulse Evelyn stooped over to see
if by chance a key was in the lock on the other
side of the door. Before she secured a good look
at the hole the door was jerked open and Evelyn
precipitated into the arms of her step-father.</p>

<p>Peter Burnham regarded her in silent indignation
as she recovered her balance and released her hold
of his arm which she had instinctively clung to
for support.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>“What is the meaning of this?” he demanded and
his voice betrayed his excitement.</p>

<p>“I was trying to see if the door was locked on
the inside.” Evelyn was a trifle breathless as well
as consumed with inward fury at having been
caught in so ignominious a position by her step-father.
“I had no idea you were in the room.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you hadn’t.” Burnham shoved his hands
deep in the pockets of his dressing gown. “Well,
if you must know, I came in to find out what you
were doing in here. Don’t deny you were here,”
as she started to speak. “I heard you from my
bedroom and came in to investigate.”</p>

<p>“You did not hear me,” Evelyn retorted. “Mrs.
Ward was in here.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Ward!” Burnham turned and gazed uneasily
about the room, and back at Evelyn. “What
was she doing here?”</p>

<p>“She said she came in to straighten the room.”
Evelyn paused in her contemplation of Burnham
and also glanced about the room. Mrs. Ward had
evidently arranged the shades and curtains so as
to darken the library, and Evelyn, her eyes accustomed
to the sun-lit hall, made out the familiar
objects with some difficulty. “I hope Mrs. Ward
did not dust,” she added as Burnham kept silent.
“Detective Mitchell expressly stated we were not
to dust in here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>“And pray where have you seen Mitchell?” asked
Burnham quickly.</p>

<p>“Here,” meeting his irate gaze calmly. “The
detective spends a great deal of time in and about
the house. Don’t you think you had better go
back to bed?”</p>

<p>Burnham muttered something she did not catch.
“Have you seen that jackass, Jones?” he asked in
a louder key.</p>

<p>“Yes, he is looking for Mother.” Evelyn’s eyes
were growing more used to the light and she saw
that a drawer of the desk table was opened, and an
over-turned scrap-basket lay on the floor near at
hand. “Why did you lock the library door?”</p>

<p>“To prevent intrusions,” replied Burnham shortly.
“The police have ordered this room closed;
very well, it shall remain closed. Please notify
Mrs. Ward to that effect, and also kindly tell Jones
to bring me my clothes. I’ll——” a coughing spell interrupted
him. “Tell Jones I’ll discharge him if
he doesn’t,” he added as soon as he could speak.
“Also ask him if he sent that telephone for Dr.
Hayden.”</p>

<p>“I heard him do that,” volunteered Evelyn. “The
doctor said he would be in after his morning office
hours were over.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right.” Burnham moved to the desk and
picked up a pencil sharpener from among the brass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
ornaments lying about. “Hurry, Evelyn, and send
Jones to my room with my clothes.”</p>

<p>But Evelyn did not start at once on her errand;
there was a feverish anxiety about Burnham which
puzzled her. His explanation of his presence in
the room was plausible; it was a natural impulse
to look in the library if he heard any one moving
about in the room closed by order of the coroner,
and perfectly proper to lock the door to prevent
others entering. But why had he not looked into
the hall on first entering the library to see who had
left the room? Why wait nearly five minutes, for
that time at least had elapsed while she, Evelyn,
had engaged the housekeeper in conversation, before
jerking open the door? And why select the
moment when she and not Mrs. Ward was standing
before it? Come to think of it, she had rattled the
knob in trying to open the door; of course, that
would attract Burnham’s attention and cause him
to find out who was trying to enter. Satisfied with
the sudden solution which had occurred to her,
Evelyn woke up to the fact that Burnham was
thumping nervously on the door which he held
invitingly open.</p>

<p>“Hurry, hurry,” he reiterated, and Evelyn sped
out of the room.</p>

<p>Burnham waited a moment after closing the hall
door and locking it securely, then taking out his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
bunch of keys he slipped the key on its silver ring
and dropped them back in his pocket. Next he
hurried over to the desk and gathered some papers
from the drawer, closed it, picked up the scrap-basket
and placed it under the desk, and taking
a pocket chess board from the table he returned to
his bedroom through the communicating door, closing
it carefully behind him. After pulling up the
shades and pushing back the curtains and flooding
the room with light, he clambered back into bed
and commenced reading over the papers he still
clutched in his hand. He was absorbed in working
out a difficult chess problem on the pocket board
when a rap on his hall door disturbed him.</p>

<p>“Come in, Jones,” he called, but instead of his
butler, Dr. Hayden walked in. Burnham’s worried
expression changed to one of relief. “I thought
you would never come,” he exclaimed, pushing
aside the chess diagrams lying on the counterpane.
“Draw up a chair and let’s talk; don’t bother about
that thermometer,” frowning. “My temperature is
normal, I’ve taken it,” pointing to a silver encased
instrument lying on the bed stand.</p>

<p>Hayden smiled as he sat down, having first,
however, poured out a glass of water from a
carafe on the stand and put his thermometer in the
glass of water.</p>

<p>“Amateur diagnosticians make work for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
physicians,” he said good naturedly. “What are
your symptoms to-day, Burnham?”</p>

<p>But Burnham did not smile. “I know what ails
me,” he retorted doggedly, his eyes shifting about
the room and then back at Hayden. “Worry has
played the devil with my digestive organs. I’ll
admit I had a beastly night, but I am all right now.
I don’t like the baby’s food my wife insists on sending
up to me, gruel and such stuff. I want a square
meal.”</p>

<p>“We’ll see.” Hayden laid his fingers on Burnham’s
wrist. “Pulse all right,” he said cheerily.
“Stop worrying, Burnham, and give your nervous
system a rest. I have told you before that you
work yourself into these excitements.”</p>

<p>“Work myself up!” exclaimed Burnham bitterly.
“Nothing of the sort. Do you think a man of my
temperament can keep calm after finding a dead
man in one of my rooms and being shot at two
nights ago—and the murderer still at large? Why,
man, my life’s in danger any hour, any moment
until René La Montagne is put under restraint.”</p>

<p>Hayden held up a cautioning hand. “Hold on,
Burnham, we do not know for certain that La
Montagne shot at you on Thursday night; your
charge is unsubstantiated.”</p>

<p>“I am morally certain of it,” declared Burnham,
sitting bolt upright. “Not only that he tried to get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
me then, but that he killed the unknown man here
on Monday night in mistake for me.”</p>

<p>“What!” Hayden regarded Burnham’s flushed
countenance with keen attention. “Come, come,
Burnham, don’t talk nonsense; be sensible.”</p>

<p>“You can think me cracked if you like.” Burnham’s
jaw protruded obstinately. “Let me tell you
something: La Montagne expected to find me here
Monday night because I wrote him to meet me
here.”</p>

<p>“You did!” Hayden stared in astonishment at
his patient. “Why did you make an appointment
with him if you did not like or trust the man?”</p>

<p>“Because I wanted him to understand, once and
for all, that neither Mrs. Burnham nor I would permit
Evelyn to marry him.” Burnham cleared his
throat, his voice having grown husky. “Evelyn
was expected in Washington and I wanted the
Frenchman told before they met.”</p>

<p>“Well, did you see La Montagne Monday night?”
asked Hayden.</p>

<p>“No, business in Philadelphia upset my plans.”
Burnham’s eyes again shifted from his physician.
“I did not reach Washington until Tuesday.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Hayden stroked his chin reflectively.
Burnham was certainly working himself into a
state of nervous agitation, and the astute physician
was wondering how much reliance to place upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
his statements. It was very obvious, however, that
Burnham was bent on talking to some one, and
Hayden decided it was better to thresh the subject
out with him, rather than have him bottle up his
spleen and nurse his wrongs, fancied or otherwise.</p>

<p>“Let us look at the situation sensibly and without
excitement,” he said. “You believe La Montagne
killed this unknown man in mistake for you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Hayden’s next question was checked by the
entrance of Evelyn whose over-bright eyes indicated
suppressed excitement.</p>

<p>“Jones has gone,” she announced, hardly greeting
Hayden as she walked over to the bed.</p>

<p>“Gone! Gone where?” Burnham half rose.</p>

<p>“I don’t know—no one knows.” Evelyn waved
her hands. “He just left.”</p>

<p>“Walked out?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” glancing in surprise at Burnham
who had almost shouted the question. He noted
her expression and modified his tone. “What have
you in your hand, Evelyn?”</p>

<p>For answer she laid a small package on the bed
and Burnham half extended his hand and then drew
it back.</p>

<p>“It’s been opened,” he exclaimed. “Who opened
it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I found the package on the hall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
table downstairs when I went to answer the front
door.”</p>

<p>Burnham pulled off the outer covering of the
package with such vigor that its contents fell in a
shower over the bed.</p>

<p>“It’s only your chess problem diagrams from
Europe,” exclaimed Evelyn, picking up one which
fell at her feet. “Why make such a fuss about
them?” observing Burnham’s growing wrath.</p>

<p>He changed the subject with abruptness. “Your
mother has repeatedly told you not to go to the
door, Evelyn, but to wait for one of the servants.
It is not dignified for you to answer the door bell.”</p>

<p>“I only went because I did not wish to keep
Detective Mitchell standing on the steps any
longer,” she protested, coloring under his rebuke.
“Mr. Mitchell said you had telephoned for him.”</p>

<p>“So I did. Why didn’t you say at once that he
was here?” glaring at her. “Ask him to come in,”
and as Evelyn made for the door he added in an
aside to Hayden: “When I send important messages
I telephone from the library.” He leaned over
and spoke in a confidential whisper. “I know I’m
watched; they can’t fool me. Come in, Mitchell,”
he called more loudly and frowned as Evelyn, her
curiosity piqued by the situation, walked determinedly
in behind the detective; then his frown
changed to a smile and he dropped his eyes so that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
the others might not see the sudden crafty malice
which lit them.</p>

<p>“Draw up a chair, Evelyn,” he suggested politely,
but disregarding his remark she walked over to the
bed and leaned against the footboard. Detective
Mitchell likewise remained standing by Hayden and
waited for Burnham to address him.</p>

<p>“Found the murderer yet?” asked Burnham.</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Identified the dead man?”</p>

<p>“Not yet, sir.” Mitchell shifted his weight somewhat
and rested one hand on the bed. “It is only a
matter of hours now.”</p>

<p>“Ah, indeed. Well, I’ll assist in pushing the
clock hands forward.” Burnham paused to sip some
water from a glass on the bedstand; his throat was
getting dry. When he addressed his companions
he spoke with deliberate impressiveness. “The dead
man was murdered in mistake for me,” he began.
“And by the same man who on Thursday night
again tried to kill me, that time by shooting.”</p>

<p>Mitchell bent eagerly forward. “Who is this
man?”</p>

<p>“René La Montagne of France.”</p>

<p>“You lie!” Evelyn, her eyes blazing with wrath,
shook the bed to emphasize her words. “You lie!”</p>

<p>“I don’t!” Burnham glared back at her and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
smiled triumphantly. “I can prove my statement.
Take down the charge, Mitchell.”</p>

<p>“One moment.” Hayden rose. “Let us talk this
over a bit, Burnham. You say that the unidentified
dead man was murdered in mistake for you
by Captain La Montagne. Did Captain La Montagne know
you by sight then?”</p>

<p>“Of course he did,” testily. “We met years ago
in Paris.”</p>

<p>Hayden shook his head in bewilderment. “Then
your theory that La Montagne mistook this unidentified
dead man for you, Burnham, hardly is
borne out by the medical evidence.”</p>

<p>“What d’ye mean?” The question shot from
Burnham, down whose hot face perspiration was
trickling.</p>

<p>“Why, simply that the man was killed by a dose
of hydrocyanic acid.” Hayden spoke deliberately to
make sure the excited man understood him. “If
these two men were drinking together, as seems a
natural supposition, La Montagne would have
known his companion was not you and would not
have administered the poison. He wasn’t shooting
at you in the dark.”</p>

<p>“Not then, perhaps——” Evelyn, who had shot a
grateful look at Hayden, whitened as she caught
the venom in Burnham’s tone. “Listen to me,
Mitchell; I want your full attention. La Montagne<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
has great reason to dislike me, to even fear me.
Be quiet,” as Evelyn endeavored to speak. “I had
an appointment to meet La Montagne here on
Monday night.”</p>

<p>“You did!” Evelyn stared astounded at her
step-father.</p>

<p>“But I was detained and could not keep the
appointment,” went on Burnham. He moistened
his dry lips before continuing. “I take back what
I said about La Montagne mistaking the dead man
for me. He undoubtedly brought the man here to
assist in assassinating me and, finding I did not
arrive, killed the man from a double motive—to
get rid of a witness who might possibly betray him
and to convict me of the crime.”</p>

<p>Evelyn stared at Burnham and then at her companions,
her eyes half out of her head.</p>

<p>“You are mad! Utterly mad!” she gasped.</p>

<p>“So that is your cue, is it?” Burnham laughed
heartily, immoderately, and Hayden edged nearer
the bed, ready for any emergency. Mitchell was
the first to speak.</p>

<p>“That’s a very neat theory,” he said, and his calm
manner had a quieting effect upon Burnham. “You
say you had an engagement to meet Captain La
Montagne here, sir, but that you did not keep it.
Then how did Captain La Montagne and this unidentified<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
man—you claim, his companion—get inside
your house?”</p>

<p>Burnham slipped his hand under the pillow and
dragged out a sheet of note paper. “Here is a copy
of my letter to Captain La Montagne making the
appointment for Monday night. In it you will see
that I said that my train might be late, and not wishing
to keep him standing on the doorstep in what
might be inclement weather, I enclosed my latch
key.”</p>

<p>Evelyn gazed aghast at Burnham and then
vaguely about the room; its familiar objects
wavered and danced before her vision and with
a pitiful cry she sank fainting into Detective Mitchell’s
arms.</p>

<small>THE BEST LAID PLANS....</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MAYNARD, pacing with nervous strides
back and forth in Palmer’s apartment,
paused in front of Dr. Hayden.</p>

<p>“Things look black,” he admitted. “Devilish
black for René La Montagne.”</p>

<p>Hayden made a last entry in his day book and
slipped it inside his pocket before answering.</p>

<p>“I am afraid they do,” he agreed. “Any news
from Police Headquarters?”</p>

<p>“Only to say that Detective Mitchell is still out;
I left word for him to call here.” Maynard flung
himself down on the lounge by Hayden. “I wish
I had been with you when Burnham preferred
charges against René; rotten luck being detained
down town and missing all the excitement.”</p>

<p>Any comment Hayden might have made was
checked by the noisy entrance of Palmer from his
work-shop, a small room at the back of his apartment
which he had fitted up with office appliances
and draughtsman’s tools.</p>

<p>“Have you seen Siki?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>“I have,” replied Maynard, “I sent him on an
errand, Palmer. Siki told me it was his time off
so——”</p>

<p>“That’s all right; glad you got some work out of
the beggar.” Palmer wheeled an arm chair forward
and dropped wearily into it. “Night work is playing
the devil with me. What is the latest bulletin
from the Burnhams’, Hayden?”</p>

<p>“Burnham ill and Evelyn better,” answered the
physician tersely.</p>

<p>Maynard laid down his cigarette case unopened.
“Had Jones reported back when you were there,
Hayden?” At the butler’s name Palmer looked up
inquisitively.</p>

<p>“Come to think of it, I didn’t inquire,” exclaimed
Hayden. “The housekeeper, Mrs. Ward, opened
the door for me and I went right upstairs to see
my two patients.”</p>

<p>Palmer stared abstractedly at his highly polished
shoes then looked over at Maynard. “Have you
notified Chief Connor that Jones has decamped?”
he inquired.</p>

<p>Maynard waited until his cigarette was lighted
before replying.</p>

<p>“I have not,” he said. “Chiefly because I am
not altogether certain Jones has decamped. On
inquiry I found that Jones has taken ‘French’ leave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
in the past, always to return some days later with
some very pat explanation for his absence.”</p>

<p>Hayden laughed. “The Burnham household is
a singular one,” he said, “whichever way you take
it. There are Mr. and Mrs. Burnham, two totally
opposite characters; there is Evelyn, young, impulsive,
and charming; there is Mrs. Ward——” He
hesitated. “A curious sort of woman, morose, secretive;
then there is Jones;” he laughed again.
“Jones is an oddity.”</p>

<p>“So odd that I have spent nearly twenty-four
hours looking up his past career,” said Palmer
dryly. “And I’ve dug up some interesting facts;
for instance, Jones has never taken out his naturalization
papers.”</p>

<p>“His naturalization papers?” Hayden sat bolt
upright. “Isn’t Jones an American?”</p>

<p>“He is not,” replied Palmer. “Some day, Hayden,
if this District is ever declared a barred zone
for enemy aliens, many Washington hostesses will
find themselves left servantless and the Kaiser will
get just so much less first hand information about
American war preparations.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean Jones is a German?” demanded
Maynard, and into his mind flashed the recollection
of his first impression when Jones admitted him on
Tuesday night at the Burnhams’; he had then detected
the faint trace of a foreign accent in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
speech, but the butler’s knowledge of English had
made him forget his first impression.</p>

<p>“He is a German.” Palmer was enjoying the surprise
his information was creating. “Not liking his
full name of Johannes, the butler, then about
twenty-two years of age, shortened it to Jones and
lengthened his given name, ‘Adolph,’ to Adolphus.
Now, Maynard,” Palmer’s manner grew serious,
“we must tell Burnham of his servant’s double
dealing.”</p>

<p>“Just a moment, sir, if you please,” put in a voice
behind Palmer, and he jumped at the nearness of
Detective Mitchell who had walked in a second
before, unperceived by the three men. “Kindly
make no mention of Jones to Mr. Burnham; Chief
Connor is handling the matter now, and it’s not
for us to interfere.”</p>

<p>Palmer colored warmly at the detective’s peremptory
tone, but controlled his anger as he remarked:
“So Chief Connor has come around to my theory
that the dead man was a German spy, has he?”</p>

<p>“I can’t say, sir, what Chief Connor thinks; he
does not confide in me,” replied Mitchell. “But I
do know that when he requests a person not to
interfere in the handling of a case, it is healthier
for the person to do what he says.”</p>

<p>Seeing the gathering wrath in Palmer’s still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
flushed countenance, Maynard hastily broke into
the conversation.</p>

<p>“Your spy theory doesn’t seem tenable, Palmer,”
he remarked. “If the man was caught spying, why
doesn’t the man who killed him come forward and
state the case? No one is going to be condemned
these days for exposing, aye, even killing, a German
spy in line of duty.”</p>

<p>“That’s a specious argument,” scoffed Palmer.
“It is just as convincing to say that if the dead
man had been a member of the Secret Service
killed by a German, his identity would be known to
American officials.”</p>

<p>“Well, so it would,” declared Hayden, glancing
in surprise at Maynard and Palmer. Maynard’s
usually tranquil manner had deserted him, while
Palmer’s expression was a clear indication of his
feelings. “It may be that the dead man was a
member of the Secret Service, but that does not
necessarily mean that the Secret Service is going
to announce that fact to the public, eh, Mitchell?”</p>

<p>“Quite true, doctor,” answered the detective.
“And it may also be that the dead man was just
an ordinary American citizen, a law abiding gentleman
who placed too much confidence in——”
Mitchell paused, then added, “in Captain La Montagne.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” protested Maynard vigorously.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
“You surely don’t place any credence in Burnham’s
charges, Mitchell; the man’s out of his head.”</p>

<p>Mitchell looked dubious. “That remains to be
proved, sir; and until the charges are refuted by
Captain La Montagne they will stand against him.”</p>

<p>“Well, why not hurry up and give him a chance
to clear himself?” demanded Maynard. “It strikes
me, Mitchell, you are not giving the captain a
square deal.”</p>

<p>Instead of replying, the detective shrugged his
shoulders. “I’ve done my best,” he insisted a moment
later. “I’ve tried to find the captain ever
since the scene this morning; but he is not at his
quarters or at the hangar, nor could I find him at
the office of the French High Commission.”</p>

<p>“Did you try the French Embassy?”</p>

<p>“I did, but he had not been there to-day.”</p>

<p>Palmer rose and offered the detective a cigar and
match. “Sit down,” he suggested as Hayden made
room for Mitchell on the lounge, then asked, “Can
you arrest a French officer detailed here for murder?”</p>

<p>“If I can prove he’s guilty, yes, Mr. Palmer.”
Mitchell puffed contentedly at his cigar. “I’ve an
operative waiting for Captain La Montagne at his
apartment and at his official headquarters. They
will notify me instantly upon his return.” Mitchell
turned and gazed about the room and then at his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
companions. “I hadn’t an opportunity, doctor,
when helping you carry Miss Preston to her room,
to ask what Mr. Burnham meant when he said
Captain La Montagne shot him on Thursday evening.
Can any of you tell me where the shooting
took place?”</p>

<p>“Here,” replied Hayden and Maynard in concert.
Palmer, whose pipe had gone out, was having
difficulty in making it draw again, and for the
moment listened in silence to his companions.</p>

<p>Mitchell viewed the room with increased interest,
and then inspected the three men. “Why have
you never reported the affair to Headquarters?” he
asked.</p>

<p>Maynard answered for the others. “I suggested
that we investigate the affair ourselves first,” he
said. “Burnham’s statement that La Montagne had
shot at him appeared to have so little foundation
to go on that——” Recollection of the scene in La
Montagne’s apartment, the Maxim silencer, and the
automatic brought him to a halt, confused; but he
recovered himself almost instantly and, making no
allusion to what had disconcerted him, he talked
on—“that we decided to keep the affair quiet until
more had developed.”</p>

<p>Mitchell listened with fixed attention and then
turned abruptly to Hayden. “Suppose you tell me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
exactly what occurred here on Thursday night,” he
suggested.</p>

<p>“Palmer can answer that better than I,” replied
Hayden, but as Palmer remained silent he added,
“I found Palmer and Burnham playing chess when
I got back after dinner, and being fagged out I
took a nap on the lounge and only woke up when
Maynard arrived.”</p>

<p>“Then we had supper,” concluded Palmer, breaking
his long silence. “That’s our dining table.
We had just about finished when a bullet whistled
by Burnham and struck the wall there.”</p>

<p>Springing to his feet, Mitchell went over and inspected
the hole.</p>

<p>“Where’s the bullet?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Palmer pried it out,” remarked Hayden, rising.
“Where did you put it?”</p>

<p>Palmer leaned forward and tipped up a small
bronze vase which stood on the table and out rolled
the bullet. “It’s chipped and mushroomed out of
shape,” he said as Mitchell pounced on it. “But a
gunsmith told me that it was undoubtedly of thirty-two
caliber.”</p>

<p>Maynard kept his face expressionless but his
heart sank; the bullet, safely tucked in his pocket,
which he had dug out of the outer wall of La Montage’s
apartment, was also of thirty-two caliber.
Could it be that that also was merely a coincidence?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
Shaking off his depression with an effort, he joined
the others about the dining table just as Mitchell
asked:</p>

<p>“Exactly where were you sitting on Thursday
night?”</p>

<p>Hayden and Maynard indicated their seats, and
the former added:</p>

<p>“Burnham sat there, almost with his back to the
window.”</p>

<p>“And Mr. Palmer sat facing Mr. Burnham.”
Mitchell laid his hand on a chair and looked from
where he stood across the room. “Surely, Mr.
Palmer, you had a good view of the window; you
must have caught a glimpse of any one standing
in the window.”</p>

<p>“But I wasn’t facing the window,” protested
Palmer. “I left the table a little before the shooting.”</p>

<p>“Where did you go?” asked Mitchell.</p>

<p>“Over to the window.” Palmer joined the group
about the table. “It was an overcast foggy night
and I did not see any one on the balcony. I had
just turned my back to the window when the shot
was fired at Burnham.”</p>

<p>Mitchell thought for a moment, then walked over
to the window and looked out. The balcony in
effect was an Italian loggia, shaded with Venetian
blinds from the glare of the sun, and ran the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
length of the living room and on past the French
window opening into the hall of Palmer’s apartment.
The balcony was fairly wide and Palmer
had fitted it up with wicker lounging chairs, a canvas
couch, a number of pretty mats, and a table.
Several artistic wicker bird-cage swinging electric
lamps added to the attractiveness of the cool little
retreat.</p>

<p>“And none of you heard a sound?” asked Mitchell.</p>

<p>“We heard no sound.” Palmer had suddenly become
the spokesman. “The man evidently used a
Maxim silencer. Thugs do, you know,” he commented
as Mitchell raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p>“Yes, thugs do,” admitted Mitchell. “But how
about Captain La Montagne? Where does he
come in?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t come in.” Palmer, as he spoke,
strolled over to the door and into the reception hall.
“When Burnham and I rushed out here we found
La Montagne standing in the corridor just outside
my door. The door was open as well as the hall
window opening on the balcony.”</p>

<p>“I see.” Mitchell jotted down several notes in his
memorandum book and then dropped it in his
pocket as he turned to Maynard. “Were you the
last person to come into the apartment before the
shooting?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>“To the best of my knowledge I was.” Maynard
looked at his companions. “That is right, Palmer,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Mitchell opened the hall door and examined the
lock. “Did you happen to notice, Mr. Maynard,
if the door was closed firmly behind you?”</p>

<p>“I never noticed,” admitted Maynard. “Siki
closed the door; I didn’t.”</p>

<p>The detective addressed Palmer. “Is it your
custom to leave the night latch down?”</p>

<p>“Sometimes; not often.”</p>

<p>Before closing the outer door Mitchell stepped
into the corridor and surveyed it, after which he reëntered
the apartment. “Have any of you taken
up this matter with Captain La Montagne?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“We did.” Palmer laid his hand on Maynard’s
shoulder. “La Montagne told us he stopped only
to inquire the way to Mrs. Van Ness’ apartment,
and that he saw a chauffeur leave here a second
before he arrived, and that he found the door partly
open.”</p>

<p>“Ah, indeed.” Mitchell frowned in indecision before
he again spoke. “Have you taken any steps to
prove the truth of his statement?”</p>

<p>There was a faint pause before Maynard spoke.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
“I’ve tried to locate the taxi-driver but without
success.”</p>

<p>“Too bad.” Mitchell’s frown deepened. “Did
Captain La Montagne describe the man’s appearance?”</p>

<p>“Only to state that he wore a chauffeur’s outfit.”
Maynard hesitated before adding, “Captain La
Montagne said he did not obtain a good look at the
man’s face as he ran away from him and up the
staircase.”</p>

<p>“But I can describe his looks,” broke in Palmer.
“He’s the man we saw on the next floor—medium
height, red hair, and freckles, Mitchell,” and the
detective took down the description. “His first
name is Sam,” added Palmer. “He drives for me
quite often and works for the Potomac Garage.”</p>

<p>“Hold on,” Maynard interrupted in his turn.
“I’ve seen Sam and he declares he did not stop
here Thursday night.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Mitchell stared at Maynard. “That puts
a crimp in La Montagne’s story.”</p>

<p>“Not necessarily,” objected Hayden. “More
than one taxi-driver comes to this apartment house.
Have you asked the janitor or the elevator boys,
Maynard, if they saw other chauffeurs than Sam
here on Thursday night?”</p>

<p>“Suppose you leave that investigation to me,”
suggested Mitchell good naturedly. “Now I’m in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
this chase I must handle it; not that your idea
isn’t a good one, doctor, but I can think of a better
now. Can I see your Jap servant, Mr. Palmer?”</p>

<p>“Certainly.” Palmer rang the bell impatiently.
“I am not sure he has returned; yes, here he is,”
as the Japanese appeared in the hall. Palmer
raised his voice. “Siki, this gentleman,” indicating
Mitchell, “wants to talk to you.”</p>

<p>The servant moved rapidly toward them and
bowed profoundly, then stood silently waiting.</p>

<p>“Siki,” began Mitchell. “Did a taxi-driver stop
here about—” he wheeled back to Palmer. “What
was the time?”</p>

<p>“Between nine and ten o’clock, on Thursday
night last,” answered Palmer. “Did he come here,
Siki?”</p>

<p>“No, honorable sir,” Siki again bowed, finger-tips
together and elbows aslant.</p>

<p>“No taxi-driver came?” Maynard looked eagerly
at the Jap. “Think, Siki; don’t make a mistake.”</p>

<p>“My memory is of the most good.” Siki spoke
with positiveness. “No such man called. You,
honorable Mr. Maynard, were the last that night.”</p>

<p>“See here, Siki.” The Jap turned to face Hayden
as the latter addressed him. “If the taxi-driver
didn’t come to this apartment at that hour on
Thursday, what were you doing in the hall just at
that moment?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>“I came to answer the bell, honorable doctor,”
responded Siki. “It rang.”</p>

<p>“We did not hear it,” declared Maynard.</p>

<p>“It rang in the pantry.” Siki’s oblique black eyes
stared unwinkingly at his questioners.</p>

<p>“How long a time elapsed between the ringing of
the bell and your answering it?” asked Mitchell.</p>

<p>“Just so long as it take me slip on white jacket
and come from pantry here,” and Siki sped lightly
down the hall and back again. “Just so long, honorable
sirs,” he said, and there was no quickening
of his breath, although he had moved with unusual
rapidity.</p>

<p>“Obviously La Montagne rang the bell,” commented
Palmer, as Mitchell picked up his hat from
the hall stand.</p>

<p>“Obviously, but not proven,” retorted Maynard,
and he also took up his hat. “Wait, Mitchell, I’ll
walk along with you. See you later, Palmer.
Will you be at the tableaux to-night, doctor?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Mrs. Burnham has very kindly asked
Palmer and me to go with them in their box.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll meet at the theater.” Maynard
nodded good-bye and stepped into the corridor; he
had taken but a few steps when Siki hurried to his
side.</p>

<p>“Here is the answer, honorable sir,” he said,
handing him an envelope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>“Oh, thanks, Siki, I had forgotten.” Maynard
slipped some loose change into the servant’s hand
and then hastened down the corridor to where
Mitchell waited for him.</p>

<p>“That’s an odd coincidence,” remarked the detective,
keeping step with him. “Did you notice
it?”</p>

<p>“No, what?”</p>

<p>“Why the ringing of a bell preceded the discovery
of the dead man in Burnham’s library, and the
ringing of another bell preceded the attempt to kill
Burnham in Palmer’s apartment.”</p>

<p>“It did not precede, it followed in this case,”
corrected Maynard. His attention was caught by
the elevator, which shot upward past their floor,
and he paused to wave his hand to Mrs. Burnham,
its one passenger.</p>

<p>Outside the apartment Maynard turned again to
Mitchell. “Do me a favor, will you; lend me a
photograph of the dead man?”</p>

<p>“Sure.” Mitchell accompanied him around the corner
and stopped in front of the Burnham house.
“Shall I send it here?”</p>

<p>“Y-yes.” Maynard hesitated. “Yes. I have
rented permanent quarters;” he glanced at the unopened
letter in his hand. “But I’ll be at the
Burnhams’ a day longer. Don’t forget, Mitchell.”</p>

<p>“I’ll send the photograph by special messenger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
this afternoon; good-bye, sir,” and Mitchell swung
on down the street.</p>

<p>Maynard, while waiting for the Burnhams’ front
door to be opened, took out the enclosure in the
envelope handed him by Siki. The letterhead bore
the firm name of a well known real estate dealer.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">“September 19, 1917.</p>

<p>“My dear Mr. Maynard:</p>

<p>“Pursuant to your telephone call this morning,
advising us that you would rent Apartment 25 in
the Bellevue, we took up the matter with the owner.
We regret to inform you that the owner had early
this morning leased the apartment to Mrs. Marian
Van Ness.</p>

<p>“We understand Mrs. Van Ness plans to furnish
and sublet the apartment, therefore we advise that
you get in touch with her——”</p>
</div>

<p>Maynard read no further. Thrusting the letter
into his pocket he walked mechanically into the
house, totally ignoring Mrs. Ward, who stood holding
the door open with every intention of addressing
him if opportunity offered.</p>

<small>IN THE LIMELIGHT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE impatient crowd, regardless of the early
hour, clamored for admittance before the
closed doors of the Belasco Theatre. From
his vantage point behind the ticket seller’s window,
James Palmer smiled at friends and acquaintances
as they pressed forward to buy tickets for the
“Tableaux of the Allies,” or secure those already
engaged. Not only would the Red Cross reap a
rich harvest from the tableaux, but the amateur
performance would be viewed by a representative
Washington audience, judging from the presence
of high Government officials, members of the Foreign
Missions detailed to Washington, diplomats;
and army and navy officers among the men and
women who thronged the lobby of the theater.</p>

<p>Palmer watched the ticket seller’s deft manipulation
of blue, red, and white pasteboards and his
swift counting of change for a while longer, then
hearing his name called he discovered Dr. Hayden
waiting for him, and he promptly hurried through
the private office into the lobby. Stopping to exchange<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
a word of greeting with several friends just
back from their summer outing, Palmer and Hayden
entered the theater and made their way to Mrs.
Burnham’s box. Mrs. Burnham, well gowned as
always, and wearing the jewels for which she was
famous, turned on their entrance and shook hands
cordially, while Burnham offered his seat to Hayden
with an ingratiating smile.</p>

<p>“Don’t talk shop, old man,” he said. “My wife
has already expressed her opinion of my leaving
my bed to come here, but——” His expression grew
hard. “Evelyn persisted in taking part in the
tableaux to-night, so we thought it, eh——” The
playing of the “Star Spangled Banner” heralding the
approach of the President and his wife, drowned
his words, and rising, he and his guests and the
whole house stood until the last bars of the anthem
were played.</p>

<p>After reseating herself Mrs. Burnham unfolded
her lorgnette and inspected first the audience and
then her program.</p>

<p>“Upon my word, I had no idea so many of my
friends were back,” she remarked, exchanging bows
with the hostess in the next box. “It is a regular
winter audience, and not such as you usually see
in September. What’s the first tableau on the program?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>“The Navy,” answered Hayden, to whom the
question was addressed. There was no further
time for conversation as the lights went out and
the curtains parted on the tableau, which elicited
rounds of applause, and the Marine Band played
the famous navy song: “Anchors Aweigh!”</p>

<p>There was some delay in the showing of the next
tableau and Hayden, idly glancing over the program
which Mrs. Burnham held so that both could
read it, grew conscious that her eyes traveled more
often to her husband, who was talking in fits and
starts to Palmer, than to the printed words before
her.</p>

<p>“What’s the idea of so many women in the
tableaux and no men?” she questioned abruptly,
breaking the silence, and Hayden marveled inwardly
at the shrillness of her usually well modulated
tone.</p>

<p>“I believe each girl personifies the spirit of our
Allies in the tableau picked out for her,” explained
Palmer, who had caught Mrs. Burnham’s question.
“Some are most artistic; I was called in to advise
about the scenery and saw some of the rehearsals.”</p>

<p>“Hadn’t any idea we had so many Allies,” announced
Burnham, glancing over the program.
“Here’s Siam and—— Hello, what’s this to be?”</p>

<p>“‘Somewhere in France.’” Hayden laid the program<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
which had slipped out of Mrs. Burnham’s
hand, back in her lap.</p>

<p>With lights extinguished the audience sat in expectation.
Suddenly before them appeared a faint
pink glow which, growing brighter, disclosed a
trench outpost overlooking No Man’s Land—the
scene of utter desolation and destruction confronting
the solitary watchful sentry, crouching gun
aslant, was finely done, and Mrs. Burnham winked
away a tear as she whispered to Hayden:</p>

<p>“One of our boys——”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Hayden borrowed her opera-glasses.
“Why, it’s Maynard!”</p>

<p>“It’s an excellent tableau!” exclaimed Burnham,
taken out of himself, and he applauded vigorously.
“No mistake about it, Lillian, Maynard makes a
magnificent soldier. Strange, as handsome and
fascinating as he is, that he has never married!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burnham nodded absent agreement as her
foot kept time to the tune, “Columbia, the Gem of
the Ocean.” Repeated calls for an encore of
the tableau brought other views of trench life, so
excellently portrayed that Maynard was far over
the time set aside for him to be the center of the
stage. He was hurrying to the wings, dodging
scene shifters, when he almost stumbled over
Evelyn standing a woe-begone figure in one corner
away from a group of her merry companions who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
were eagerly or nervously, as the case might be,
awaiting their turn to appear in the tableaux.</p>

<p>“Have you seen Marian anywhere?” she asked,
and her disappointment was evident at his negative
answer. “Where in the world can she be?”</p>

<p>“In one of the dressing rooms perhaps,” suggested
Maynard.</p>

<p>“No; the stage manager said she had not come,
and he is wild because her tableau follows mine.”
Evelyn came a little nearer and lowered her voice,
a needless precaution as the noise about them,
added to the playing of the Marine Band, made it
almost impossible to hear even a shout. Maynard
would not have understood her but for his ability
to read lips.</p>

<p>“Have you seen René La Montagne?”</p>

<p>“Not yet,” he shouted and she whitened under
her make-up.</p>

<p>There was no opportunity to question him further
as the stage manager demanded her presence.
Maynard lent his aid in arranging her tableau
which represented Belgium, and assisted in lashing
her to the wheel of the gun carriage. It was a
very effective tableau. Evelyn half knelt, half
crouched against the wheel, and raised her eyes at
the stage manager’s husky command and gazed in
despair ahead of her, the hushed audience nowhere
in sight as her mental vision conjured up her gallant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
French lover in the toils of circumstantial
evidence.</p>

<p>Maynard halted near one of the wings out of
sight of the audience to watch the tableau. A sudden
draught of cold air caused him to look around
and he saw Marian Van Ness just emerging from
the circular staircase, which gave access not only
to the dressing rooms under the stage, but to the
stage door opening upon the alley. Marian did not
pause until she reached the wing where he was
standing, and he forbore to address her, noting her
absorption in the tableau.</p>

<p>“And what does Jeanne d’Arc think of modern
Belgium?” he inquired a few minutes later.</p>

<p>Marian started violently at sound of his voice.</p>

<p>“Jeanne’s mantle has fallen on the women and
men of Belgium,” she answered readily, but her
hand tightened its grasp on the sword she carried.
“How lovely Evelyn is to-night.”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Maynard, who had drawn nearer to let
a stage hand pass, made her a courtly bow. “Congratulations
on your costume. You have carried
out every detail of the celebrated picture of the
Maid of Orleans.”</p>

<p>“Thanks.” Under the armor she wore, Marian’s
heart beat faster as she caught the fascination of
his eyes, and the soft cadence of his alluring voice.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
“Evelyn is having great applause. Ah! the tableau
is over.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Van Ness!” The agitated stage manager
pounced upon her. “I feared you hadn’t come.”</p>

<p>“We worked late at the State Department——”
but what else she said was lost to Maynard, who
had gone to Evelyn’s assistance.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Van Ness will be in the next tableau,” he
said, as Marian, stopping but a second to congratulate
Evelyn, followed the stage manager to the
center of the stage. “We can’t see it very well
from the wings, suppose we slip out in the audience;
we can come back again,” he added, as
Evelyn made no move to accompany him.</p>

<p>“Won’t we be seen?” she asked.</p>

<p>“No, we can stand in the aisle. Come this way,”
and his familiarity with the playhouse enabled him
to guide her to the door opening into the auditorium.
They stopped just beyond the entrance in
the aisle and from there had an excellent view of
the tableau. Marian’s pose was striking and something
of the fire and mysticism of the heroic
Frenchwoman whom she impersonated lighted her
beautiful face.</p>

<p>“She is wonderful!” whispered Evelyn, enthralled,
as spontaneous applause filled the theater.
In the semi-darkness a man, hurrying to the stage
door, bumped into Maynard and at his muttered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
apology the latter recognized Detective Mitchell.
His expression caught his attention and he checked
him.</p>

<p>“What’s up, Mitchell?” he asked, lowering his
voice to a whisper so that his words would not
reach Evelyn who, absorbed in the tableau being
shown again, had slipped into a vacant aisle seat.</p>

<p>“Mr. Maynard!” Mitchell halted. “Beg pardon,
I didn’t recognize you. Can you slip out here
just a minute?” observing Maynard’s backward
glance at Evelyn.</p>

<p>Maynard tiptoed to Evelyn’s side and whispered
in her ear. “Come out through that door when
you are ready; I’ll wait for you on the stage.” She
nodded her comprehension and Maynard stole out
after Mitchell. He found the detective impatiently
waiting at the foot of the circular iron steps leading
to the stage.</p>

<p>“Headquarters has just been notified that Captain
La Montagne is to sing here to-night,” he said,
taking care to keep his voice low. “I’ve got to
see him.”</p>

<p>“But not here,” protested Maynard sharply.
“Tut! you don’t want a scandal.”</p>

<p>“It’s bound to come,” retorted Mitchell philosophically.
“We can’t postpone making an arrest
any longer over this Burnham business; why, the
whole town is holding us up to ridicule.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>“Better be ridiculed for masterly inactivity than
be excoriated for committing a blunder,” cautioned
Maynard. “Let me talk to La Montagne first.”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, wait and get him alone at his apartment.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been trying for twelve hours to reach him
at his apartment,” replied Mitchell. “He is too
elusive to let out of my sight. Coming up with
me?” as Maynard lagged back. Before the latter
could step forward, the door opening upon the
alley swung in and René La Montagne appeared.
He started past Maynard with but a courteous
salute at sight of the latter’s uniform, but his voice
halted him.</p>

<p>“Ah, <i>mon ami</i>, is your tableau over then?” he
exclaimed. “I have tried many times to speak with
you on the telephone, but alas, the Central would
not listen to my directions.” He paused in his rapid
French to glance upward at Mitchell, who loitered
on the step above them, and addressed the detective
in English. “Pardon, monsieur, will you permit
that we pass?”</p>

<p>“In just a minute.” Mitchell looked significantly
at Maynard. “Please explain to Captain La Montagne
who I am,” he requested. His manner was
not to be denied and Maynard accepted the situation.</p>

<p>“René,” he began, “this is Detective Mitchell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
of the Central Office. He is in charge of the investigation
of the Burnham mystery.”</p>

<p>“The Burnham mystery?” The Frenchman
wrinkled his forehead. “You refer to——”</p>

<p>“The dead man found in the Burnham library,”
volunteered Mitchell. “This morning, Captain La
Montagne, Mr. Burnham made the statement that
you were responsible for the man’s death.”</p>

<p>“I responsible!” La Montagne in his astonishment
stepped backward on the narrow platform and but
for Maynard would have lost his balance and fallen
off the step and down the circular staircase to the
floor below. “Mon Dieu! you are not sane!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am,” responded Mitchell, nettled by La
Montagne’s contemptuous smile. “Mr. Burnham
preferred the charges against you.”</p>

<p>At Burnham’s name La Montagne’s surprise
changed to indignation. “And does he dare to go
to such lengths in his hatred as to accuse me, a
cadet of a noble house, of a crime so base!” With
a violent effort La Montagne controlled his temper.
“Upon what grounds does he make such a charge?”
he inquired more calmly.</p>

<p>“That he had an appointment to meet you Monday
night in his house and that he sent you his
latch-key to get in with, so that you would not have
to wait outside the house for him,” explained
Mitchell, watching carefully to see the effect of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
words. But his long statement had given the
Frenchman time to pull himself together, and he
was master of his feelings as he answered.</p>

<p>“I had the appointment,” he stated. “But I did
not keep it.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” demanded Mitchell.</p>

<p>“Because I lost my way in the storm—you recall
the storm of Monday——” Mitchell mumbled a reluctant
“yes,” and La Montagne continued rapidly.
“I am not familiarly acquainted with your circles
and streets, and I lost my way in the blinding rain
and hail. I wandered about for many weary hours,
and returned to my hotel drenched to the skin.”</p>

<p>Mitchell stared at him. “Have you any witnesses
to prove your statement?” he asked, and
the Frenchman flushed hotly.</p>

<p>“My word, monsieur, is good——”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes—but you may have to face a court of
law,” warned Mitchell.</p>

<p>“Go slow!” commanded Maynard, breaking into
the conversation. “Recollect, Mitchell, in your zeal
you may overstep your authority.”</p>

<p>Mitchell contented himself with a glare at Maynard
as he again addressed the Frenchman.</p>

<p>“Witnesses are very good things, sir,” he said
wisely. “Just a word more; do you admit that Mr.
Burnham sent you his latch-key?”</p>

<p>La Montagne disregarded Maynard’s indignant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
ejaculation and answered promptly. “I received
the key, Monsieur; what then?”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess that’s enough——” Mitchell
stepped nearer the Frenchman who faced him
calmly.</p>

<p>“I will add,” said La Montagne and his voice was
very quiet, “the latch-key was not in my possession
on Monday night.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t?” Mitchell almost shouted the question,
while Maynard stared in wonder at the
Frenchman.</p>

<p>“<i>Non, monsieur</i>,” continued La Montagne tranquilly.
“The latch-key had been stolen from my
apartment on Monday afternoon.”</p>

<p>Mitchell gazed open-mouthed at his two companions,
but before he could think of anything to
say the stage manager ran down a few steps and
stopped at sight of La Montagne.</p>

<p>“Hurry up!” he exclaimed much relieved. “You
are to sing the <i>Marseillaise</i> now; the audience is
waiting,” and he almost dragged the Frenchman up
the few steps, Mitchell standing back to let him
pass. But he was hard on his heels a moment later
and only stopped in the wings as La Montagne
walked out toward the center of the brilliantly
lighted stage.</p>

<p>Maynard, who had followed his companions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
more slowly, came face to face with Marian Van
Ness at the head of the stairs.</p>

<p>“Have you seen Evelyn?” she asked anxiously.
“I want her to go home with me.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell her,” he promised and she smiled gratefully
at him.</p>

<p>“Do, please; I’ll run and get my cloak, which one
of the maids put in our dressing room,” and she
disappeared as Maynard hastened down the steps.
He had been gone but a second when Mrs. Burnham,
assisted by Dr. Hayden, clambered up the
staircase and looked helplessly at the busy scene.</p>

<p>“Dear me, where will we find Evelyn?” She
turned to address a scene-shifter, but the man
passed without paying the slightest attention to her
hail.</p>

<p>“Just sit here, Mrs. Burnham,” Hayden guided
her to a chair standing against the wall. “I’ll look
up the stage manager; he will know where Evelyn
is to be found,” and he darted behind some scenery.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burnham listened with interest to the echoing
chorus of the <i>Marseillaise</i>, which was being
played by the Marine Band and sung by the audience.
Suddenly spying a bevy of girls toward the
back of the stage she rose and walked in their
direction.</p>

<p>Mitchell, observing that La Montagne was singing
an encore, turned away just as Hayden appeared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
at the entrance to the wing and promptly
accosted him.</p>

<p>“Have you seen Miss Preston?” he asked as the
detective paused by him.</p>

<p>“Haven’t laid eyes on her.” Mitchell looked over
toward the staircase. “Isn’t that she?” and he and
Hayden stared at a heavily cloaked woman standing
with her back toward them. She was peering intently
at the floor when Hayden’s approaching footsteps
caused her to look around and he recognized
Marian Van Ness.</p>

<p>“Good evening,” he exclaimed, raising his hat.
“Have you lost anything?”</p>

<p>“Yes—I, that is, no——” Marian laughed to hide
her embarrassment. “Have you seen Evelyn?”</p>

<p>“No. I am searching myself for that elusive
damsel,” laughed Hayden. “Her mother is waiting
to take her home.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Marian looked blank. “Then in that
case I’ll run along. Good-night; don’t trouble to
come with me,” and she hurried down the circular
staircase.</p>

<p>Mitchell, who had listened unobtrusively in the
background, stepped up to Hayden. “She’s a beauty
and no mistake!” he remarked admiringly. “Gee,
don’t fall!” Seeing her stumble on the last step
he sprang forward, tripped over one of the iron
uprights of the stair railing, and went sprawling.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
His out-flung hand closed over a small object to
which he clung instinctively as Hayden helped him
somewhat shakily to his feet.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” he muttered, as the physician brushed
off some of the dust, accumulated in his fall. Unclosing
his fingers he looked at the object in his
hand; his breath entirely left him, and he pointed
with his right hand to the decoration.</p>

<p>“Look, doctor!” he gasped and Hayden bent
nearer, then his glance traveled upward and he and
Mitchell contemplated each other in silence. A
hand on Mitchell’s shoulder caused him to start
violently.</p>

<p>“What have you there?” asked Maynard.</p>

<p>For answer the detective raised his hand until the
nearest electric light fell full upon it.</p>

<p>“The Iron Cross!” he exclaimed and his voice
was shaky.</p>

<p>“So it is,” answered Maynard, looking more
closely at it and the string attached to the cross.
“Stage property or genuine article, Mitchell?”</p>

<p>An irate voice from the foot of the staircase
hailed Hayden.</p>

<p>“Heh! Hayden, do you think I want to stay here
all night?” demanded Burnham. “Here’s Evelyn,”
as the stage door opened and his step-daughter
joined him on the platform of the staircase.
“Where’s my wife?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>Hayden looked around. What had become of
Mrs. Burnham? His unspoken question was answered
by finding her almost at his elbow.</p>

<p>“I am coming, Peter,” she called. “Don’t excite
yourself,” and bowing to Maynard, she accepted
the physician’s assistance, but Hayden as he
helped her carefully down the staircase and into
the waiting carriage wondered at the hotness of
her hand.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br>

<small>CAMOUFLAGE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">CORONER PENFIELD paused in his microscopic
examination of the polished surface
of Burnham’s desk and laying down his instrument,
listened attentively. He could have
sworn he had heard a faint rustle of skirts. Moving
with noiseless speed over to the doorway he
peered into the hall, himself screened from view
by the portières, but the hall was empty. After
remaining behind the portières for fully five minutes,
he again crossed the library and sat down
before the desk and renewed his occupation of ransacking
the drawers. With the aid of a skeleton
key he unlocked first one and then another, but only
neat rows of filed bills and canceled checks rewarded
his search and he sat back finally, gnawing
his underlip. His eyes strayed about the room and
he frowned meditatively at the clock as it chimed
the hour; ten o’clock was early for an amateur
performance to be over, but——</p>

<p>Penfield closed and locked each drawer and replaced
every ornament on the desk where it had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
originally stood, its place clearly indicated by the
accumulation of dust which, by his order, the
servants had been forbidden to remove. Rising, he
took a thorough survey of the library. Mrs.
Burnham had evidently seen that his instructions
about keeping the room intact had been carried
out; every piece of furniture was where he recalled
seeing it after the discovery of the dead man sitting
in the chair by the fireplace five or was it
six—Penfield stopped to count—had five days
elapsed since then? No arrests, no identification
of the dead man in that time! Memory of a stinging
editorial in a local newspaper on the subject of
police inefficiency in handling the case made him
wince. The editorial had hardened his resolve to
make another examination of the Burnham residence,
and upon hearing of the family’s contemplated
absence at the theater that night he had
decided to take the opportunity to once again go
over the premises.</p>

<p>Crossing the room Penfield again examined the
huge arm chair in which the dead body had been
found. He shook his head despondently over the
same blank results which had met his former investigation
of the upholstery of the chair; there
was no clue to be found in its spotless and unbroken
surface, no niche where a paper might have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
been secreted, or spot where tell-tale finger marks
had been left to aid in identifying the criminal.</p>

<p>With something very like an oath Penfield
straightened up from his fruitless search and again
transferred his attention to the library. Four
questions confronted him: the identification of the
dead man, how he had been carried into the library,
from where, and by whom.</p>

<p>The coroner stared at each piece of furniture, at
every section and corner of the large room, but no
solution of the problem met his eager gaze in his
orderly surroundings. His idea of being of aid to
Detective Mitchell by a quiet examination of the
room was a failure; no new viewpoint of the crime
had presented itself.</p>

<p>Penfield turned restlessly about and faced the
massive carved mantel which added much to the
attractiveness of the library. The high brass andirons,
their globe-shaped tops reaching almost to
his chest, were badly in need of polishing, and the
fire irons and screen were equally dingy. They
were the only furnishings of the room which
showed the result of closing the house during the
summer months.</p>

<p>Penfield’s eyes traveled upward and along the
high shelf of the mantel, which stood some distance
above his head. The small bronze figures on either
end of the shelf were handsome, but his eyes did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
not linger on them and passed on to the next objects,
candlesticks, and then were focused on the
center ornament—the mantel clock.</p>

<p>The clock was evidently of French make, and
the coroner admired the handsome gilt work which
encased the glass globe inside of which were exposed
the works of the clock, its dial, and the pendulum,
which in that instance was obviously the
loose base of the clock, and revolved slowly half
around and back again as the seconds and minutes
were ticked off. But it was the dial of the clock
which had claimed the coroner’s wandering attention.
Taking out his note book, he turned its pages
hurriedly until he came to an entry under the date
of Tuesday of that week: “Clock in library going
at time of discovery of dead man, and time registered
accurate to the minute with my watch.”</p>

<p>Penfield frowned at the clock. How had he
come to overlook questioning Evelyn regarding the
clock? Had she set it going on entering the library
Tuesday morning? If she had not, it would effectually
prove his theory that some one had occupied
the house in the absence of the Burnhams. Penfield
brightened; he had found something tangible
to work on after all by refreshing his memory in
his re-examination of the room.</p>

<p>Standing on tip-toe, for his medium height did
not permit his reaching behind the clock, Penfield<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
felt along the shelf for a key to the clock. Meeting
with no success, he pulled forward a chair and
mounting it, looked behind the clock, then under
the bronze figures, and lastly under the candlesticks,
but he could find no trace of a key. He next
essayed to open the glass door of the clock, but the
catch stuck and pull as he might he could not open
it. A discreet cough behind him interrupted his
efforts and he swung about with such speed that
he almost lost his balance. Jones, the butler, laid
a steadying hand on his chair.</p>

<p>“Beg pardon, sir,” he said contritely. “I thought
you heard me come in, sir.”</p>

<p>The coroner sprang down from the chair.
“What is it you wish?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“The housekeeper said I was to report to you
that I had returned, sir.”</p>

<p>“Returned? Returned from where?”</p>

<p>“From my day off, sir.” Jones, with careful exactness,
replaced the chair from where the coroner
had taken it. “Can I get you anything, sir; sandwiches——?”</p>

<p>“Not a thing, thanks.” The coroner’s brusque
manner cut short the butler’s loquaciousness.
“Where’s the key to this clock?” A jerk of his
finger indicated the mantel shelf.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, sir.” Jones stepped forward and
peered along the shelf, his height giving him that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
advantage over the coroner’s stocky figure. “Isn’t
it alongside the clock?”</p>

<p>“It is not.”</p>

<p>“Then you’ll have to ask the master,” replied
Jones, and his manner had lost some of its servility.
“Or Mrs. Burnham,” he added as an after-thought.
“The key is generally kept on the shelf. Mr.
Burnham’s very fussy about all the clocks in the
house and we have strict orders not to meddle with
any of them.”</p>

<p>“I see.” Penfield thought a moment, then walked
over and, closing the hall door, locked it. He balanced
the key in his fingers before pocketing it.
“Tell Mr. Burnham I will return the key to-morrow,”
he said by way of explanation as he
stopped long enough to pick up his hat from the
chess table where he had placed it on first entering
the library, and then walked over to the door opening
into Burnham’s bedroom. He waited until
Jones had followed him into the latter room, then
turned and locked that door, pocketing its key without
hesitancy.</p>

<p>Before again addressing the waiting servant Penfield
took a careful survey of Burnham’s bedroom.
Its simple furniture appealed to him, as well as the
neat array of long tables which, with built-up sides,
resembled open card index drawers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>“What’s all this?” he asked, approaching the
tables.</p>

<p>“Mr. Burnham keeps his chess problems and
records filed there,” explained Jones. “He receives
problems, he calls them, from all over the world;
and the time he spends fussing over them!” Jones
rolled his eyes. “It’s enough to make him daffy.
Here, don’t touch ’em, sir,” as the coroner removed
several chess problem diagrams. “Mr. Burnham will
raise——” He stopped as Penfield, after a cursory
glance at the red and black markings in the small
squares, dropped the diagrams back into place.
“Mr. Burnham’s terrible passionate when he’s
roused, sir,” he added apologetically. “I only
thought to caution you, and no offense was meant.”</p>

<p>“And none taken, Jones,” answered Penfield.
“So Mr. Burnham is of a passionate nature, is he?”
Not waiting for the butler’s fervid “Yes,” he
walked out of the bedroom, Jones just behind him.
In the hall he stopped. “Which way is Mr. Maynard’s
bedroom?”</p>

<p>“Right down the hall, sir, to your right,” and
Jones led the way past the open door of Mrs.
Burnham’s bedroom, which adjoined that of her
husband, to the room he had indicated. Stepping
inside he switched on the electric light and Coroner
Penfield looked into the room for a moment only.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>“Cozy quarters,” he remarked. “And who has
the room across the way?”</p>

<p>“Miss Evelyn.” Jones stepped to one side to
permit Penfield to return to the hall.</p>

<p>“And that room?” Penfield indicated a doorway
at the back of the hall, a little to one side.</p>

<p>“That leads to Mrs. Burnham’s boudoir, sir, in
the octagon wing of the house; leastways, that is
what they call it,” explained Jones. His voice
gained in impressiveness; he would have made his
mark as a lecturer and the house was his hobby.
“There’s a lot of surprises about this house, sir;
it’s bigger than most folks think.”</p>

<p>“I have been over the house.” Coroner Penfield
paused by the staircase. “I thought Mr. Maynard
had a room on the third floor.”</p>

<p>“So he did, sir.” Jones led the way down the
stairs. “But Mrs. Ward had his things moved into
the spare bedroom downstairs, as Mrs. Burnham
feared it was too hot for him on the third floor;
not but what he might have been more comfortable
with a suite of rooms all to himself upstairs,” added
Jones, stopping respectfully by the entrance to the
drawing room. “Will you go in and wait for Mr.
Burnham? I heard he would be back early.”</p>

<p>Penfield considered a moment, then moved toward
the front door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>“I will be around in the morning,” he said.
“Please tell Miss Preston I desire to see her.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir.” Jones held wide the door and
watched the coroner down the steps and saw him
turn the corner before he again entered the house,
closed the door and returned to his pantry. He
was some minutes putting away plates, and then
gathering the soiled dishcloths which the second
man had left in an untidy heap on the floor, he
turned off the light and went downstairs. The
light in the lower hall had been left burning but
dimly and in the almost complete darkness Jones
stumbled against a heavy object and with difficulty
kept his balance.</p>

<p>“Look out for my bag,” exclaimed a cold voice
back of him.</p>

<p>“<i>Schwein-hund!</i>” The word slipped between
the butler’s clenched teeth as he tenderly nursed his
bruised shin, and with difficulty suppressed his desire
to kick the bag down the hall as a small vent
to his feelings. Suddenly he straightened up and,
turning up the gas jet under which he stood, glared
at Mrs. Ward, but her wooden expression gave no
indication of having heard his ejaculation or observed
his sudden badly concealed fury. Controlling
himself by a supreme effort, he hid his feelings
under his familiar suave manner.</p>

<p>“Why do you leave your bag in the way?” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
asked, at the same time stooping to stand the suit case
upright against the wall. “Shall I carry it
upstairs for you?”</p>

<p>“No, put it down.” Mrs. Ward’s acerbity was
unmistakable and Jones released his hold of the
bag with alacrity, while silently marveling at its
weight. “Go answer the bell, imbecile; do you not
hear it ringing?”</p>

<p>Casting down the soiled dishcloths on top of
the bag, Jones dashed by the housekeeper and ran
upstairs, the front bell keeping up a ceaseless din
as he hurried along; but in spite of his haste he
paused long enough to scratch his bald head before
opening the door.</p>

<p>“The bag had an ‘M’ on it,” he muttered. “It
was no ‘W.’ I have a mind——” Another imperative
summons on the bell sounded and he jerked
open the door.</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Maynard in?” asked Marian Van Ness
as she stepped across the threshold.</p>

<p>“Mr. M-M-Maynard,” stuttered Jones, his surprise
at sight of Marian plainly evident. “No,
miss, no ma’am.” Catching sight of her expression,
his own changed to one of concern. “Are you
ill, ma’am?”</p>

<p>“No.” Marian rubbed her cheeks, forgetting
they were rouged, and unaware that it was the expression
of her eyes which had alarmed the butler.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
“I have lost—I would like——” she pulled herself
up short. “Has Miss Evelyn returned from the
theater?”</p>

<p>“Not yet, ma’am.”</p>

<p>Marian moved over to the hall seat and sat down
wearily. “Get a sheet of paper and a pencil,
Jones,” she directed. “I want to leave a note for—for
Mr. Maynard.”</p>

<p>“Surely, ma’am.” Jones fumbled about on the
hall table and produced a much chewed pencil and
a small piece of folded paper. “Just write your
message here, ma’am, and I’ll give it to Mr.
Maynard.”</p>

<p>Marian threw back her cloak and the butler inspected
her striking costume of Jeanne d’Arc with
admiring eyes. Forgetful of Jones’ presence,
Marian stared at the blank paper, then wrote a few
lines, and folded it into a cocked hat, added “Dan
Maynard, Esq.,” in her distinctive writing and
handed the note to Jones.</p>

<p>“I will be greatly obliged, Jones,” she said, stepping
to the door, “if you will not mention my
presence here to-night to any one, but give my note
to Mr. Maynard.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, ma’am, I understand.” But the butler’s
face was blank as he closed the door behind Marian
and went slowly down stairs. He quickened his
footsteps on hearing subdued voices in the hall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
leading to the basement front door, and reached
there just in time to see the housekeeper hand her
suit case to a taxi-cab driver.</p>

<p>“Here, wait!” he called, but instead of complying
the taxi-driver slipped outside and Mrs. Ward shot
the bolt into place before turning to face the irate
butler.</p>

<p>“Hold your fuss!” she exclaimed authoritatively.
“And mind your own business.”</p>

<p>“It is my business to know who comes here at
night,” stormed Jones, giving vent to his bottled up
anger at last. “Think you Mrs. Burnham likes to
have hangers-on at her kitchen door?”</p>

<p>“And think you she likes to have such companions
as you bring here?” Mrs. Ward’s blood
was up. “The man whom the police want—the
man you have kept here.”</p>

<p>Jones looked involuntarily over his shoulder.
“Not so loud,” he cautioned. “Heinrich has joined
the Mission; he seeks Divine guidance.”</p>

<p>“Then let him seek it elsewhere than in this
house.” Mrs. Ward turned contemptuously away.
“Pick up your clothes and be off.”</p>

<p>Jones gathered up the soiled dish towels in silent
fury. As he tucked them under his arm some dark
stains on one cloth caught his eye.</p>

<p>“Ah! Paint is it or ink?” He sniffed at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
cloth, holding it close under his nose. “And why
did you put fresh paint on your suit case?”</p>

<p>Instead of replying Mrs. Ward walked into the
servants’ dining room and, sitting down, composedly
picked up her knitting. Jones hesitated uncertainly
in the hall, then, thrusting the note which Marian
had given him inside a pocket, he followed Mrs.
Ward into the room and stationed himself opposite
her.</p>

<p>“Why did you alter the initial on the suit case?”
he demanded, and waited in growing wrath for an
answer. Receiving none, he again addressed the
housekeeper. “Silence will not help you,” he announced.
“I know—all.”</p>

<p>“Then why ask me questions?” inquired Mrs.
Ward practically.</p>

<p>“Because I desire to know why that taxi-driver
is here so often; in the back way; in the window,
yonder,” pointing to the one opening on the walk
which separated the Burnham residence from
its next door neighbor, and which gave light
and air to the rooms on that side of the house.
“What does he here of so secretive a nature?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ward laid down her knitting and met his
angry gaze with one equally furious.</p>

<p>“What concern is it of yours?”</p>

<p>“That is my affair.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>“That is no answer.” Mrs. Ward shrugged her
shoulders disdainfully.</p>

<p>“Then shall I say,” the butler leaned closer,
“shall I say that that man’s jack-in-the-box presence
in this house is for you a menace?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ward’s laugh did not ring quite true.</p>

<p>“Since you must know——” She commenced, and
paused to glance over her shoulder.</p>

<p>“Yes.” Jones came nearer. “What?”</p>

<p>“That man you call ‘jack-in-the-box’——”</p>

<p>“The taxi-driver,” prompted Jones. “Go on,
woman!”</p>

<p>“That man——” the loud buzzing of the front
door bell interrupted her. “Answer the bell.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, in a moment.” Jones came yet nearer.
“The taxi-driver—who is he?”</p>

<p>“A detective—now go,” and Mrs. Ward resumed
her knitting.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br>

<small>“THE HANDWRITING ON THE WALL”</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BY the time Jones reached the front hall he
found the door open and Mrs. Burnham
awaiting his arrival with an angry sparkle
in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Late again, Jones,” she remarked, and her tone
caused the butler to flush uncomfortably. “Help
Mr. Burnham off with his coat and then assist him
to bed.”</p>

<p>Burnham rejected the butler’s aid with the same
petulance he had shown to Maynard when the
latter offered his assistance.</p>

<p>“I’m not a baby,” he remarked through chattering
teeth. “What if I did catch a chill coming
home, Lillian; it’s nothing serious. Here, take my
keys, Jones, and bring me some whiskey from the
sideboard.” Jerking the bunch of keys from the
front door lock where he had left it dangling in his
haste to enter the house, he tossed it to the waiting
servant, and laying his hand on Maynard’s arm
started with him up the staircase. Mrs. Burnham
turned to follow when Evelyn, who had remained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
in the vestibule, stepped inside the house, closed
the door, and called her softly by name.</p>

<p>“Come in the dining room, Mother, dear,” she
said. “I must have a word with you, alone,” and
the quiet emphasis on the last word belied her unnaturally
high color and brilliant eyes. “Please,
Mother.” Seeing Mrs. Burnham hesitate, she moved
forward and gently encircled her waist with her
arm. “Spare just a moment to me.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burnham bent forward and kissed her with
warmth. “Of course, Evelyn,” she said cheerily.
“Say as many words to me as you want,” and she
led the way into the drawing room, pausing only
long enough to turn on the lights.</p>

<p>“Sit by me here,” she suggested, making herself
comfortable on the sofa, but Evelyn, too nervous
to remain quiet, only paused in her restless moving
about to stand in front of her.</p>

<p>“Mother,” she began, and in spite of her determination
to keep her voice steady it shook. “I love
René La Montagne.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burnham’s expression altered. “You think
you do, Evelyn,” she corrected gently.</p>

<p>“No, Mother.” Evelyn’s gaze never shifted. “I
love René and I intend to marry him.”</p>

<p>“Need we go into that?” Mrs. Burnham smiled, not
unkindly. “Suppose for to-night we just admit the
first premise—you love him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>“Thank you, Mother.” Evelyn rested her hands
against the table at her back and steadied herself.
“René,” she blushed hotly. “René loves me.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burnham gazed steadily at her daughter and
a sudden wave of tenderness swept over her, and
for a second the charming picture—Evelyn in her
straight young beauty and her tattered Belgian costume—was
blurred from sight by blinding tears.
Unconscious of her mother’s emotion, Evelyn
waited a moment before speaking.</p>

<p>“René loves me and I love René,” she reiterated.
“Therefore; Mother, will you announce our engagement
to-morrow morning?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burnham sat bolt upright. “Will I do
what?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“Announce my engagement to René La Montagne.”</p>

<p>“My dear child,” Mrs. Burnham raised her hands
in horror. “Utterly unthought of!”</p>

<p>“But why? René and I have thought of it, and
we are the most concerned.”</p>

<p>“Preposterous!” fumed Mrs. Burnham. “Why,
the man’s under a cloud!”</p>

<p>“Exactly, mother; that is why I wish our engagement
announced.” Evelyn stood proudly
erect. “Shall you make the announcement or I,
Mother?”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_252">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_252.jpg" alt="“René loves me.”">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“René,” she blushed hotly, “René loves me.”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Mrs. Burnham stared at her in blank astonishment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
“Have you taken leave of your senses?” she
demanded. “Sit down here, Evelyn, and let us
discuss this matter rationally.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, Mother, but I prefer to stand. I—I
will not keep you long; in fact,” her smile was
very winning, “I but wait your answer.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burnham sighed. “The perversity of life!”
she exclaimed. “Why do you pick out the one
man I could not welcome as a son-in-law?”</p>

<p>“But why can’t you welcome him?” asked Evelyn
impetuously. “René is all that a man should be—tender,
true, and brave. Look at the record he had
made in that gallant army of France. You have
every reason to be proud of René, mother. Why,
then, are you so absurdly prejudiced against him?
He has never done anything to you.”</p>

<p>“Not to me perhaps——” began Mrs. Burnham,
but Evelyn gave her no time to finish.</p>

<p>“Is it fair to take Mr. Burnham’s opinion about
René instead of mine?” she demanded hotly. “My
word is just as good as his, if not——”</p>

<p>“Stop, Evelyn.” Mrs. Burnham held up her
hand imperatively. “It is not a question of word
but of judgment; you are immature, impulsive, impressionable——”</p>

<p>“Good gracious, Mother,” Evelyn laughed vexedly.
“Any more ‘ims’ you can think of? Mr.
Burnham is determined to get René into trouble,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
and it is plain to be seen that he has influenced
you against me.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burnham flushed. “You are unjust, Evelyn,”
she remonstrated. “You carry your dislike
of your step-father too far——”</p>

<p>“You mean he has carried his dislike of René too
far,” retorted Evelyn, bitter resentment against
Burnham getting the better of her determination to
curb her anger. “He has, even to preferring false
charges against René.”</p>

<p>“Gently, Evelyn, gently.” Mrs. Burnham rose.
“Do not say things in anger which you may bitterly
regret later.”</p>

<p>“I shall never regret one word I say in defense
of René,” responded Evelyn with undaunted spirit
“And when Mr. Burnham charges René killed that
unknown man in our library, he lies.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burnham laid a firm hand on Evelyn’s
shoulder. “Hush!” she commanded. “René will
have an opportunity to prove his innocence shortly.
I understand——” She faltered for a second, then
continued sternly: “I understand he has been arrested
for the crime.”</p>

<p>Evelyn shrank back from her mother and covered
her face with her hands. When she looked
up her expression had altered.</p>

<p>“Either you or I will announce in to-morrow’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
papers my engagement to René—which shall it be?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“Evelyn.” Mrs. Burnham seldom used that tone
in addressing her daughter and the girl looked at
her dumbly. “Have you considered what such a
step means in the face of my disapproval?”</p>

<p>“You mean—giving up my fortune?”</p>

<p>“Yes. By the terms of your father’s will you
forfeit your inheritance if you marry against my
wishes.”</p>

<p>“Well, what of it?” Evelyn shrugged her shoulders
disdainfully. “Thank God, money isn’t everything!”</p>

<p>“You are very young.” Mrs. Burnham smiled
faintly. “In this case there is more than money
involved; a crime and public scandal. Child!”
For a second Mrs. Burnham’s composure deserted
her. “You must be mad to desire to announce your
engagement to a man whom your step-father
charges with a heinous crime.”</p>

<p>“Charges can be disproved,” retorted Evelyn.
“Mother,” she laid an imploring hand on her arm.
“Mother, I assure you René is not guilty, no matter
how much circumstantial evidence points to him;
he no more killed that man than did Peter
Burnham.”</p>

<p>Rapidly approaching footsteps caused Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
Burnham to turn abruptly and she welcomed Maynard’s
entrance almost with eagerness.</p>

<p>“I have persuaded your husband to go to bed,”
he said. “I think he will rest very comfortably.
He has given me a prescription to fill for him; can
you tell me where to find the nearest drug store
which stays open all night?”</p>

<p>“I am afraid it is fully six blocks away, on Connecticut
Avenue,” exclaimed Mrs. Burnham. “It
is a shame to take you out at this hour of the
night.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it.” Maynard nodded gayly at
Evelyn. “Too bad you can’t stroll down town with
me, Evelyn, the walk might do you good; not in that
thin dress,” hastily. “Fortunately, to-night I was
cast for an appropriate costume; uniforms are not
conspicuous these days.”</p>

<p>“Our uniforms are always conspicuous,” rebuked
Evelyn. “Just think of the gallant men wearing
them.”</p>

<p>“All honor to them!” Maynard raised his hand
in quick salute. “Some day, God willing, I’ll go
up the line with the boys in khaki and over the top;
until then——” A quick sigh completed the sentence.
“I’ve taken your latch-key, Mrs. Burnham, so don’t
have any one wait up for me,” and he hurried out
of the house.</p>

<p>“Go to bed and get some rest, Evelyn,” suggested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
Mrs. Burnham, pausing with her hand on the electric
light button. “We can talk more reasonably
after a good night’s sleep. Come and see me after
breakfast, and remember——”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mother.” Evelyn waited for her mother
to lead the way up the staircase. But Mrs. Burnham
did not complete her sentence until she had
reached the second floor. In front of her door she
turned and patted Evelyn gently on her shoulder.
“Remember,” she said, “do nothing rash.”</p>

<p>It was not until Evelyn was in her own bedroom
arranging her hair that she recollected her mother
had omitted her customary good-night kiss. Evelyn’s
lip quivered; her sensitive high-strung nature
made her a prey to every slight, however unintentional
or imaginary they were. She felt cruelly the
barrier which she had been quick to see was slowly
but surely separating her from her mother, a
mother she had idolized up to the time of her marriage
to Peter Burnham.</p>

<p>She had never been able to conquer her distaste
for Peter Burnham and her growing fear that he
might some day supplant her in her mother’s affections.
She had little hope that she could win her
mother’s consent to her engagement to René La
Montagne, and still less that her mother would announce
the engagement. But Evelyn came of a
loyal courageous race and her fighting blood was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
up. Her lover, alone in a strange country, faced,
in her opinion, unjust imprisonment for a crime he
had not committed, and she was determined to offset
her step-father’s charges against him by the
announcement of their engagement. Let tongues
wag in society and scandal be whispered; if she
showed her faith in René La Montagne others
would rally to his aid. There was Marian Van
Ness and Dan Maynard— A tap on her door
awoke her from her abstraction.</p>

<p>“What is it?” she called.</p>

<p>“It is I, Miss Evelyn,” announced Mrs. Ward,
pushing the door farther open. “Your mother
thought you might need my help in getting out of
that dress. Let me do that for you,” and she deftly
extracted a pin Evelyn had been vainly trying to
reach for some moments.</p>

<p>“Thanks.” Evelyn submitted to being undressed
with alacrity; she was utterly weary.
“Aren’t you up pretty late for a woman who has
been as ill as you have?”</p>

<p>“I am well again,” replied the housekeeper, arranging
Evelyn’s clothes neatly on a chair and
picking up brush and comb. “Just slip into bed,
Miss Evelyn, and I’ll brush and braid your hair
for you.”</p>

<p>With a murmur of thanks Evelyn followed her
advice and partly sat and lay at ease while the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
experienced woman (she had graduated from lady’s
maid to her position of housekeeper) deftly arranged
her long silky hair, badly tangled from
having worn it loose down her back in the tableau.</p>

<p>“There, Miss Evelyn, that is done,” Mrs. Ward
announced twenty minutes later. “Is there anything
else you would like?”</p>

<p>Evelyn looked about the room. “If you will
open all my windows and raise the shades, I shall
be greatly obliged,” she said. “The room is horribly
hot.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ward hesitated perceptibly. “I’m afraid
you are a bit feverish,” she exclaimed. “Do you
think it’s wise to open all the windows, Miss
Evelyn? This room really isn’t any too warm.”</p>

<p>“I can’t sleep in it as it is,” exclaimed Evelyn.
“I must have air; my head is swimming. Don’t
worry about my catching cold, Mrs. Ward; I
always sleep with the wind blowing on me.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Miss Evelyn.” The housekeeper went
to first one window and then the other and pulled
up the Holland shades, then flung the windows
wide open. On her way to the door she stopped
by the bed and looked thoughtfully down at Evelyn,
then without speaking glided from the room to
return a moment later with a silver whistle.</p>

<p>“If the room gets too cold, Miss Evelyn, and you
don’t want to get up, just blow on this and I’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
come downstairs and help you,” she said, laying the
whistle in Evelyn’s hand.</p>

<p>Genuinely touched, Evelyn raised herself on her
elbow. “That’s very thoughtful and kind of you,”
she exclaimed. “Thank you so much.”</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it, Miss Evelyn, good-night,”
and Mrs. Ward hurried away.</p>

<p>Sleep was far from Evelyn’s eyes and for long
hours she tossed and turned on her pillow; the cool
night air gradually lowered the temperature of the
room and she felt relief. She had a touch of
fever, she admitted to herself, touching her hot
forehead, and half determined to get up and
rummage around in her mother’s medicine cabinet
for a bottle of “sweet spirits of niter,” but the
thought of waking her mother deterred her.</p>

<p>As the night passed Evelyn slept by fits and
starts. She was lying drowsily awake listening to
a distant clock chiming three when she grew conscious
of a light streaming directly in her eyes.
Her lids flew open and she blinked for a few
seconds before realization came to her. Jerking
herself up on her elbow she gazed at a thin wave
of light shining steadily through one of the windows
full on her pillow. Too weary to do more
than stare, she finally pulled her pillow around
and settled herself in another position. She was
just dozing off when the light again aroused her.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
Three times she changed her position and each
time the light shone directly in her eyes. There
was something uncanny in its power and its silent
search only for her eyes. Evelyn felt a chill creep
down her spine; then, conquering her nervousness,
she reached over to a chair near the bed where lay
her wrapper and proceeded to put it on. There
was nothing for her to do but get up and pull down
her window shades.</p>

<p>Suddenly just as she was about to spring out of
bed a flash of light on the blank wall opposite her
bed caught her attention and glancing up she was
horrified to see vividly outlined there the scene of
Tuesday morning—the large library chair with the
dead man sitting with head thrown back, and once
again she gazed in breathless suspense straight into
the man’s wide open staring eyes.</p>

<p>Evelyn sat spell-bound; then shuddering she covered
her eyes with her hands and cowered back.
When she looked up again the wall opposite was
blank. Closing her eyes she pressed the lids down
with her finger-tips and kept them so for at least
ten minutes. The next time she looked at the
wall the space was still blank, and steadying her
shaken nerves with the thought that her imagination
was running away with her, she started to
rise when before her eyes appeared a cord, exaggerated
in size against the blank wall; suspended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
apparently by unknown, unseen means in mid-air,
it twined about like some uncanny snake, but even
as it twisted to and fro, Evelyn recognized the
peculiar style of the cord—she had seen it three
times before: taken from the dead man’s pocket,
hanging from the open parcel in her hand two days
later, and given to her the next afternoon by Dan
Maynard.</p>

<p>With desperate fingers Evelyn groped under her
pillow for the silver whistle—she would not stay
another minute alone; she must tell some one of
her hallucination before she went entirely out of
her head. With eyes averted from the opposite
wall, she twisted about in bed until the missing
whistle turned up under her left elbow.</p>

<p>Blowing the whistle was not as simple a business
as she had anticipated; her mouth was dry and
parched and such breath as she had in her body
only raised a feeble pipe; but in desperation she
persevered. She was bathed in perspiration before
a sound of footsteps brought unspeakable relief.</p>

<p>“Hurry, hurry,” she gasped, as a white-robed
figure stepped just inside her room. “Come
nearer. Look!” and with eyes averted she pointed
to the opposite wall.</p>

<p>She was conscious of the figure’s approach at
her hoarse whisper, but the continued silence
snapped her last remnant of self-control.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>“Tell me you see it,” she begged piteously.
“The string, Mrs. Ward; you see the string!” and
she caught the woman and swung her about, imploring
eyes upraised—the woman who faced her
was not the housekeeper, but her mother.</p>

<p>“Be calm, Evelyn,” she said, stroking the girl’s
hot head. “What is the meaning of this?”</p>

<p>“Can’t you see the string on the wall?” asked
Evelyn clinging to her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burnham looked in the direction Evelyn
pointed.</p>

<p>“No, dear,” she whispered soothingly. “Look
for yourself.”</p>

<p>Slowly, reluctantly Evelyn turned and looked
full at the wall—her mother was right, it was
blank. But even as she stared at it, the wall lightened
and once again she gazed into the eyes of the
dead man seated in the chair facing her.</p>

<p>“See, Mother!” she cried.</p>

<p>Like one carved from stone Mrs. Burnham
stared at the opposite wall; motionless, almost with
breathing suspended, she continued to look ahead
of her. Suddenly she spoke, and it was a voice
Evelyn had never heard before and would never
have recognized as hers.</p>

<p>“I see nothing, Evelyn,” she said. “The wall is
blank.”</p>

<small>BRIBERY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">JAMES PALMER felt his clean shaven chin
with nervous fingers and turned away from
contemplating himself in the mirror with a
dissatisfied scowl. Kicking aside his tumbled
clothes, which lay half on, half off the bed, he hurried
into the living room of his apartment in time
to catch Dr. Hayden as the latter was leaving on
his round of professional visits.</p>

<p>“Give me a bracer, Hayden,” he demanded.
“My nerves have gone to pot.”</p>

<p>Hayden scanned him closely and noted with professional
interest his bloodshot eyes and shifting,
ever moving restless fingers.</p>

<p>“Go back to bed,” he directed. “You are not in
shape to be about this morning.”</p>

<p>“Shape or not, I’ve got to be in my office
Sunday or no Sunday; Government contracts don’t
wait on nerves, time, or day. Those cantonment
plans must be shipped to——” Observing Hayden’s
obdurate manner, Palmer’s peremptory tone
changed to one almost of pleading. “Don’t send<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
me to bed; I tell you I can’t sleep and I’ll go crazy
if I remain inactive. I <i>had</i> to work last night;
God knows if I can’t sleep at night, I can’t sleep
in daylight.”</p>

<p>Hayden considered him a moment, then drawing
out his prescription pad he wrote down directions,
and tearing off the slip handed it to Palmer who,
impatient to be off, stood twirling his hat from one
hand to another.</p>

<p>“This mild bracer will give you relief, Palmer,
but only temporarily.” Hayden’s serious manner
impressed Palmer in spite of his open disinclination
to follow his advice. “It is trite but true that
no man can burn the candle at both ends; working
under pressure day and night creates the necessity
for sanitariums.”</p>

<p>Palmer frowned then smiled as he tucked the
prescription safely away in his vest pocket.</p>

<p>“The work will lighten up shortly,” he declared.
“Come along; oh, d——mn! there’s the ’phone.”</p>

<p>“Don’t wait, I’ll answer it,” and Hayden turned
back into the apartment as Palmer hurried down
the corridor. Just as he reached the head of the
staircase a sound of voices drifted to him, and
glancing over his shoulder he saw Mrs. Burnham
leave the elevator and walk toward his apartment.
Palmer stood for several seconds where he was;
then, as Mrs. Burnham was admitted by his Japanese<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
servant, Siki, he slowly retraced his footsteps
to his apartment.</p>

<p>Inside the living room Hayden listened to a long
winded statement from one of his patients, and
making his replies as brief as politeness permitted
he finally hung up the receiver and, swinging about,
found Mrs. Burnham seated near at hand.</p>

<p>“I telephoned to your office and the boy told me
you were not expected there this morning, so I
chanced finding you here,” she explained as they
shook hands. “I want your professional advice.”</p>

<p>“Surely, Mrs. Burnham.” Hayden drew a chair
forward and sat down by her. “What is it?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burnham did not reply at once. “Are we
likely to be interrupted?” she finally inquired.</p>

<p>“No,” replied Hayden. “Palmer left before you
came, and Siki is busy in his pantry.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burnham’s tense manner relaxed somewhat.
“I want to speak to you on confidential matters,”
she said. “You will kindly mention my visit to
no one.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not.” Hayden bowed. “Proceed,
madam.”</p>

<p>It was some minutes before Mrs. Burnham again
addressed him; she seemed at first uncertain how
to commence.</p>

<p>“I sent for you this summer to come to Chelsea,”
she began, “so that you might have Mr. Burnham<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
under observation; I told you that at the time.”
Hayden bowed again. “You said then that you observed
a tendency on his part to brood and to withdraw
himself from the society of his friends.”</p>

<p>“True,” responded Hayden gravely. “His chief
relaxation, aside from long solitary walks, seemed
to be to lock himself in some room and work over
chess problems. I advised you to use your influence
to induce him to be more with people.”</p>

<p>“I have tried to do so.” Mrs. Burnham was
exerting her superb self-control to keep her voice
tranquil. “Without, however, satisfactory results;
now he even dislikes my society.”</p>

<p>Hayden glanced at her keenly. “A morbid
tendency very often makes people turn against
those they love the most,” he said gently. “As
Burnham’s physical condition improves he will
shake off his mental depression. In my opinion,
Mrs. Burnham,” he added more lightly, “half the
murders and suicides to-day are the result of a
torpid liver.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burnham’s answering smile was wan. “Then
you think his, shall we say, distorted views of
people and events are the result of physical illness
reacting on his mental condition?”</p>

<p>“It is possible,” conceded Hayden; again he
eyed her keenly. “You have mentioned no specific
case——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>“I am coming to that.” Mrs. Burnham bent
forward in her earnestness. “How much reliance
can I place on my husband’s active dislike for
Captain René La Montagne and the charges he has
brought against him?”</p>

<p>Hayden considered the question. “It is difficult
to answer,” he admitted, “I do not know the
grounds, if any, your husband has for hating—frankly,
on the surface it amounts to that—” he
added hastily—“for hating the Frenchman.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burnham colored painfully. “As I understand
it, Captain La Montagne was a passive witness
of an unfortunate scene in a club in Paris
in which my husband did not—did not”—she
faltered——“did not cover himself with glory; but
I must say, in justice to him, that he was brought
up in the tenets of the Quakers and dueling or
fighting of any kind is——”</p>

<p>“I know,” broke in Hayden kindly. “It is highly
probable that Burnham has become possessed of
this notion, this dislike of La Montagne, contradictory
alike to common-sense and his own experience,
until it has developed into almost a monomania
with him.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burnham drew a long, long breath. “Then
do you think he has brooded over a long past
incident and centered his resentment on La Montagne<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
until it has become an obsession?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes; so it seems to me.”</p>

<p>“Then you think he has taken the—the—shall we
call it chance——” Mrs. Burnham whitened—“the
chance of that unidentified man having been killed
in our empty house, to involve Captain La Montagne
in the crime so as to punish him for an imaginary
grievance,—in his mental condition,—exaggerated
out of all proportion to its real significance?”</p>

<p>“It may be,” Hayden hesitated, “but you must
recollect that circumstantial evidence also points to
Captain La Montagne.”</p>

<p>“I do not place much confidence in circumstantial
evidence,” declared Mrs. Burnham. “Captain
La Montagne if innocent, should have little
difficulty in proving it, but——” Mrs. Burnham
cleared her voice of a slight huskiness—“but I
am willing to swear in any court that my husband’s
attitude toward him is due to mental irresponsibility.”</p>

<p>A spark of admiration kindled Hayden’s eyes
as he gazed at the composed woman seated
before him; in his creed loyalty ranked high.</p>

<p>“Your claim seems justified by facts,” he said.
“I would suggest——”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“That you set the machinery in motion to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
Mr. Burnham placed under mental observation,” he
added reluctantly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burnham averted her gaze. “Only as a
last resource,” she said. “At present I wanted
your views to assist me in deciding upon a course
of action.” She paused and he waited with silent
attention. It was some moments before she spoke
again. “My daughter, Evelyn, wishes to announce
her engagement to Captain La Montagne to-day.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Hayden sat back and contemplated her
in surprise.</p>

<p>“Quite so.” Mrs. Burnham’s smile was wintry.
“Evelyn’s behavior complicates the situation,” she
admitted with candor. “I have had quite enough
gossip about my private affairs;” her tone grew
bitter. “People perhaps do not think I know the
things which were said at the time my engagement
to Mr. Burnham was announced, but there are
always kind friends;” she laughed mirthlessly.
“Women do not spare their own sex, doctor; even
my daughter’s intimate friend, Marian Van Ness,
stated I only married Peter to get rid of him.”</p>

<p>The frantic ringing of the telephone bell interrupted
her, and with a hasty apology Hayden
crossed the room to the instrument. Mrs. Burnham
seized the opportunity to relax in her chair;
the interview had taxed her strength. Happening
to glance in the direction of the door she saw the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
Japanese servant pass down the hall, long wall
brush and dust pan in hand; another instant and
Dr. Hayden was back at her side.</p>

<p>“Evelyn is in a state of mind to do anything,”
she stated, as he resumed his seat. “She is quite
as possessed in favor of Captain La Montagne as
my husband is opposed to him.”</p>

<p>“A pleasant situation for you,” acknowledged
Hayden, and his sympathetic manner was a tonic to
her frayed nerves. “Do you anticipate an elopement?”</p>

<p>“No, oh, no.” Mrs. Burnham spoke more rapidly
than ordinarily. “Evelyn simply desires the immediate
public announcement of her engagement
under, in my opinion, a mistaken sense of loyalty
to Captain La Montagne. I have begged her to
tell only her intimate friends and relatives——”</p>

<p>“Ah! then you have agreed to the engagement?”
asked Hayden quickly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” reluctantly. “Frankly, doctor, Evelyn’s
condition this morning worried me, and I thought
the best thing to do was to accede as far as possible
to her wishes. It quieted her and she spent the
remainder of the night without seeing visions.”</p>

<p>“Visions!” exclaimed the astonished physician.</p>

<p>“Yes,” tartly. “I was awakened by a whistling
noise which seemed to come from Evelyn’s room,
and on going in I found her sitting up in bed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
apparently frightened half out of her senses and
declaring that she saw against the opposite wall
the unidentified dead man, sitting in the chair as
she had found him in the library on Tuesday
afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Upon my word!” Hayden stared at Mrs. Burnham;
she was certainly serious in her statement.
Was the entire Burnham household going mad, or
was his hearing defective?</p>

<p>“Evelyn seldom speaks of the scene in the
library,” went on Mrs. Burnham. “But finding the
body must have made a greater impression upon
her than any of us realized. She was very much
wrought up to a feverish degree. Mrs. Ward told
me this morning, by an interview she had with me
about René La Montagne just before going to bed,
and I am afraid her mind must have reverted back
to the dead man and her mental distress projected
her vision of him on the wall,” ended Mrs. Burnham.
“Isn’t that what you physicians call it?”</p>

<p>Hayden looked puzzled. “An illusion—counterfeit
appearances,” he explained, “is an incorrect
impression of the senses. Has Evelyn ever had
other illusions?”</p>

<p>“Never to my knowledge.” Mrs. Burnham rose.
“I have left her in bed in Mrs. Ward’s care. I
wish you would come in sometime during the day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
doctor, and see her. In the meantime, I can’t
thank you enough——” Mrs. Burnham’s fine eyes
filled with tears and she stopped unable to control
her voice.</p>

<p>“My dear Mrs. Burnham,” Hayden shook her
hand warmly. “Say no more; I am only too delighted
to be of service to you; you forget, but I do
not, your long years of kindness and hospitality to
me.”</p>

<p>Taking her knitting bag from the sofa where
she had dropped it, Mrs. Burnham started for the
door, and Hayden, snatching up his surgical bag
and hat, accompanied her out of the apartment and
down in the elevator.</p>

<p>They had been gone fully five minutes before
James Palmer rose from his chair in the corner of
the balcony and looked through the open window
into the empty living room.</p>

<p>“A clever woman, a very clever woman,” he
commented aloud. Turning abruptly he stepped
through the French window opening into the hall
of his apartment and went in search of the
Japanese, Siki.</p>

<p>“Go out on the balcony and put new electric
bulbs in the bird-cage lanterns,” he directed. “We
want to sit out there to-night after dinner.”</p>

<p>Not waiting for a reply he left the apartment and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
was just in time to catch a descending elevator.
The boy had shut the elevator door when Palmer
caught sight of Peter Burnham walking down the
corridor, and he had but time to call out: “Sorry
to miss you; Hayden’s gone,” when the elevator
shot downward.</p>

<p>“I’ll wait for Hayden,” shouted Burnham, and a
moment later was explaining his presence and
desires to the attentive Japanese.</p>

<p>Siki ushered him into the living room with a
grand flourish, then went off to execute his master’s
orders with sublime disregard of Burnham’s presence.</p>

<p>The morning papers first engaged Burnham’s
attention; the chess table added its fascination, but
finally, tiring of both occupations, he wandered over
to the window opening upon the balcony, a tinkle
of glass having attracted his notice. He stood for
some seconds looking out at the Jap sweeping up
pieces of a broken electric bulb and watched him
screw another in place in one of the silk-lined
bird-cage lanterns.</p>

<p>“Siki,” he called. “Come here,” and as the Jap
approached the window he drew out a twenty
dollar bill.</p>

<p>“See here, Siki,” he began insinuatingly. “You
know Captain La Montagne was in this apartment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
Thursday night just before the attempt was made
to shoot me.”</p>

<p>The Jap looked first at the bill and then at
Burnham, his expression inscrutable.</p>

<p>“Me understand, honorable sir,” he admitted and
pocketed the money.</p>

<small>IDENTIFICATION</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MARIAN VAN NESS turned restlessly
away from the window as her old servant
came into the sitting room.</p>

<p>“Are you quite sure no telephone call has come
for me, Mammy?” she asked with gentle insistence.
Mammy’s antipathy to the telephone was known
to her; on occasions she had not answered it in
Marian’s absence, having confided to the cook in
the next apartment that it was little short of uncanny
and she wanted nothing to do with the
“devil’s works.”</p>

<p>“Aint been no call at all,” Mammy assured her
with conviction. “I jes’ sat in my kitchen wif de
do’ open alistenin’ fo’ dat and de do’ bell, as yo’
said yo’ was ’spectin’ company; aint eben been in
hyar to tidy up.”</p>

<p>As she spoke Mammy proceeded to “set to rights,”
as she termed it, the mass of books, electric light
paraphernalia and torches which littered the window
ledge and to put each chair in orderly array.
Marian, who had kept a luncheon engagement of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
some days’ standing and returned afterward as
promptly as possible to her apartment, moved away
so that her old servant would not see the keen disappointment
her statement of no callers and no
telephone calls had given her.</p>

<p>Marian bitterly regretted the almost insane impulse
which had prompted her to seek out Dan
Maynard the night before, to even leave a note—a
note he had ignored and left unanswered. Her
cheeks burned at the thought.</p>

<p>The bang of a heavy book which Mammy inadvertently
let fall startled her so that she dropped
her ball of worsted which she was winding with the
aid of a chair back. Mammy’s rheumatic joints
cracked as she stooped over, but Marian was before
her.</p>

<p>“Don’t bother, I’ll pick it up,” she said, and retrieving
her ball, which had rolled under a table,
she sat back somewhat flushed from her exertions,
the book balanced open in her lap.</p>

<p>Looking more closely she saw it was an edition
of “Who’s Who,” and in sheer idleness turned over
its leaves as she continued winding the ball. Suddenly
her eyes, traveling listlessly down one page,
stopped, arrested by Dan Maynard’s name. Putting
aside the worsted, she lifted up the book and read
the long paragraph devoted to his accomplishments,
his stage career, and his place of birth—Berlin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>Mammy finished her work and seeing Marian
sitting staring in absorbed attention at an open
book, concluded not to interrupt her reading, and
hobbled from the room. In the kitchen she paused
to ruminate before putting on her spotlessly clean
white apron, her “Sunday best.”</p>

<p>“’Pears like Miss Marian aint herself no mo’,”
she muttered, sorrowfully. “Why dat man got ter
com’ back an’ torment her mo’? I s’pose de good
Lord knows His business, but thar’s times when
us mortals could give Him p’ints. Laws! who
dat?” The sudden clang of the front door gong
startling her into dropping her apron. Mammy’s
heart sank, when on opening the door a moment
later, she gazed up into Dan Maynard’s handsome
face; and it was only with much self-restraint that
she managed to answer with any civility his inquiry
for her beloved “Miss Marian.”</p>

<p>Marian made no motion to rise as he entered
and her frigid bow was far from cordial. An
awkward pause followed.</p>

<p>“Won’t you sit down?” she asked, finally, and
Maynard with suppressed indignation quietly took
the chair next to hers; in doing so he dislodged
the worsted which she had carefully stretched
across the chair back.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” he exclaimed contritely.
“I never noticed the worsted; very stupid of me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>“Don’t bother, please.” Marian turned about and
rested one hand on her desk. “Have you brought
back my blotter?”</p>

<p>Maynard sat upright, the neglected worsted at
his feet.</p>

<p>“Your blotter?” he echoed. “What blotter is
that?”</p>

<p>“The one you took from here Friday night.”</p>

<p>Maynard stared at her. “I am an absent-minded
beggar,” he said, and his smile was whimsical. “If
I accidentally walked off with your blotter that night
I apologize and will bring you another one to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Marian stiffened. “I allude to the blotter I
unfortunately used when decoding a message from
the State Department; the message on it was very
clear;” her voice stumbled as she met his astonished
gaze. “The blotter was missing the morning after
your call.”</p>

<p>Slowly her meaning dawned on Maynard.</p>

<p>“Good God! Marian, do I understand you accuse
me of stealing a blotter with the imprint of a decoded
message from the State Department on it?”
he demanded.</p>

<p>“Yes.” The monosyllable cost her an effort which
Maynard’s indignation blinded him to.</p>

<p>“You think me a spy, a traitor—<i>you</i>?” he stammered,
his face gone white.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>“What else am I to think?” she retorted drearily.
“Your unexpected and unexplained return—oh, I
know ‘war work’; war work, these days, like charity
sometimes covers a multitude of sins.”</p>

<p>“My war work——” began Maynard hotly, and
stopped short.</p>

<p>“Your war work,” she repeated. “Well, is it
for Uncle Sam or for the Kaiser?”</p>

<p>Maynard held up a protesting hand. “Let us
talk reasonably,” he said. “There is no occasion
for excitement. What induces you to think I am
working for the Kaiser?”</p>

<p>“Your fondness of the German people;” she
stopped and spoke more slowly. “Were you not
born in Germany?”</p>

<p>“Surely.” Maynard’s smile showed his strong
white teeth. “Accidents do happen, Marian, even
in the selection of a birth-place. My parents were
Americans, and my ancestors were Norman-French
and Anglo-Saxon. You cannot question
my loyalty to Uncle Sam on those grounds.”</p>

<p>“Were you not decorated by the Kaiser?” demanded
Marian, her blood tingling at his faintly
humorous manner of taking her serious accusation.</p>

<p>“I was, several years ago.” Maynard’s smile disappeared.
“Suppose I answer what must come
next in your ‘<i>questionnaire</i>’,” he suggested and a
certain sternness crept into voice and manner. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
can give you no account of my whereabouts during
the past twelve months, or——” He paused—“my
occupation. Come, Marian, old comrade, take me on
faith?” and he flung out both hands, his voice
soft and winning.</p>

<p>“If I only could!” He caught the look that
flamed her eyes and the next instant she was in
his arms, his voice dangerously sweet as he murmured
loving, adoring words in her ear, and then
holding her close he kissed her passionately. Suddenly
she broke from his embrace.</p>

<p>“No, no,” she cried. “I sent you away once and
I must do so again. It was madness on your part
to break down the barrier——”</p>

<p>“The barrier, Marian, no longer exists,” he
stated softly, and she sprang up.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” she demanded breathlessly.</p>

<p>He answered her question with another: “Did
you see the unidentified dead man whom Evelyn
found Tuesday afternoon in the Burnham library?”</p>

<p>“I? See him?” His eyes never left her white
strained face, but she was unconscious of his
scrutiny. “No, I did not see the man. Why?”</p>

<p>For reply Maynard unbuttoned his coat and took
from an inner pocket a photograph and handed it
to her. In silence she stared at the dead man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
sitting in the library chair; in silence she looked up
at Maynard.</p>

<p>“He’s dead,” she stammered. “Really dead?”</p>

<p>“Yes—thank God!” answered Maynard, and at
the look which crept into his eyes she turned and
with a low cry pillowed her head on her arms
across the desk and lay as one dead.</p>

<p>Maynard waited in silence for fully five minutes,
then he called her softly.</p>

<p>“Can I be of service?” he asked. A shake of her
head was the only sign that he heard.</p>

<p>“Do you wish me to stay?” he asked, and had
to stoop to catch her muffled: “No.”</p>

<p>Picking up his hat in the hall he paused in uncertainty;
then recollection of Mammy’s presence
in the apartment convinced him that he was not
leaving Marian alone, and opening the door he went
slowly down the corridor to the elevator shaft.</p>

<p>He had been gone a scant three minutes when
Mammy’s black face peered out from Marian’s bedroom;
a second later she was by Marian’s side. At
her loving touch Marian sat up and Mammy’s
glance strayed from her blanched face to the photograph
lying face up on the desk.</p>

<p>“I heerd all,” she said in a husky whisper. “An’
he’s daid,” touching the photograph. “’Peers like
de Lord do know His business, but de debble musta<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
sent Marse Dan to de Burnham house on Monday
night.”</p>

<p>“H—h—ush!” And Marian clasped her in an
agonizing grip as her terrified eyes swept the pretty
room. “Hush!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br>

<small>UNMASKED</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MAYNARD, swinging his cane jauntily as
he strode along, paused a few steps from
the Bellevue Apartment House and swore
softly; he had entirely forgotten the errand which
had, ostensibly, taken him to see Marian. Retracing
his footsteps he persuaded the telephone operator
to give him a small envelope and writing on
his visiting card: “Evelyn wishes to see you at
your earliest convenience,” he enclosed it in the
envelope, and insured its immediate delivery by a
liberal tip to the grinning elevator boy.</p>

<p>His conscience once again clear he hastened
around to the Burnhams’ and reached that hospitable
home just as Jones appeared on the doorstep
intent on summoning a newsboy whose shrill
shout of “<i>Sunday Times</i>” could be heard a block
away.</p>

<p>Maynard paused by the butler’s side. “Get a
paper for me also,” he directed, producing some
pennies.</p>

<p>“Don’t bother, sir,” protested Jones. “I always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
gets four for the house, sir; I have the money right
here.” In hunting for his change the butler resurrected
a folded paper. His face fell at sight of it.
“Heavens, sir; I forgot to give you this,” he gasped
in consternation. “Mrs. Van Ness—that is——” Suddenly
recollecting that Marian had requested him
not to mention her presence at the house the night
before, he pulled himself up short and under pretence
of saving the newsboy steps he went forward
to meet him.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_285">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption"><span class="smcap">White to Play and Mate in Two Moves.</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But the maneuver was unnecessary. Maynard
had forgotten the butler’s existence. His entire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
attention was concentrated on the small piece of
paper which upon unfolding, proved to be a chess
problem diagram. Underneath it was written:
“White to play and mate in two moves.”</p>

<p>For several seconds Maynard studied the position
of the men, then wheeling about he raced up
the staircase and disappeared in his bedroom, in his
haste utterly ignoring Mrs. Burnham’s friendly
greeting as he passed her in the hall.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burnham frowned at his closed door in
surprised indignation; discourtesy in any form was
like a red rag to a bull to her, and making up her
mind that she would exact full apology from Maynard
later on, she continued on her way to Evelyn’s
bedroom. There she found Evelyn, fully dressed,
sitting on the edge of her bed, one hand pressed to
her side and her face the color of the bed sheets.</p>

<p>“Mother, please get me some aromatic spirits
of ammonia,” she begged. “I thought I was
stronger——”</p>

<p>“I told you to remain in bed,” retorted Mrs.
Burnham in marked displeasure. “Remember,
your promise——”</p>

<p>“Oh, mother, don’t argue,” gasped Evelyn. “I
really think I am going to faint.”</p>

<p>“Tut, nonsense!” responded Mrs. Burnham; she
had small sympathy with hysterics, and Evelyn
seemed on the verge of indulging in them. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
raised her voice as footsteps stopped outside the
door: “Who’s there?”</p>

<p>“Me, ma’am, Jones,” replied the butler, holding
the door ajar. “Coroner Penfield to see Miss
Evelyn.”</p>

<p>A faint “Oh!” from the bed reached Mrs. Burnham
and her hesitation vanished.</p>

<p>“Tell the coroner we will see him shortly, Jones;
show him into the library; he has the key, I believe,”
and as the butler closed the door she approached
the bed and handed Evelyn a glass of water.
“Drink some of that, dear,” she said more sympathetically.
“I will bring you some ammonia; lie
down until I return.”</p>

<p>Not waiting to see her directions carried out,
Mrs. Burnham went at once to her dressing room
and unlocked her medicine cabinet. The bottle she
sought was not in front, and in moving some of
the phials to see the better she was confronted with
a small blue bottle bearing the ominous red sign
“POISON”, and the label:</p>

<p class="center">Acid Hydrocynan dil<br>
Dose 1-3 minims</p>

<p>The bottle drew her hand as the North Pole
attracts the magnet. Holding it up to the light
she tipped the bottle and the small amount of
hydrocyanic acid remaining in it showed plainly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
She hesitated a long moment, then secreted the bottle
in her hand-bag. Spotting the ammonia after a
second search she hastened back to Evelyn and
gave her a small dose.</p>

<p>“Do you feel equal to seeing the coroner?” she
asked.</p>

<p>Evelyn nodded. “It was foolish of me to make
a scene,” she admitted. “But I am weaker than
I realized. Will you come with me, Mother?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear,” and slipping her hand within
Evelyn’s she gently helped her across the hall and
into the library.</p>

<p>There was distinct rumbling of thunder and the
darkness preceding the heavy electrical storms,
almost tropical in their violence, which visit Washington
occasionally, was creeping up; even the air
was oppressive and Mrs. Burnham shivered involuntarily
as she entered the library with Evelyn
and greeted the coroner.</p>

<p>“Sorry to keep you waiting,” she said graciously.
“My daughter is not very well, so you must excuse
us.”</p>

<p>“I’ll not detain you long, Miss Preston.” Penfield
noted Evelyn’s haggard appearance with concern.
“There are just one or two questions I must ask
you; for instance, did you on your arrival here
Tuesday morning wind that clock?” pointing to
the mantel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>“No, but it was going,” replied Evelyn positively.</p>

<p>“Ah, then some one besides yourself wound it.”
The coroner’s air of triumph at having established
his theory of the house being occupied in the absence
of the Burnhams was quickly dashed by Mrs.
Burnham.</p>

<p>“The clock runs for a year,” she stated. “We
wound it last June.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” The coroner stared at her in acute disappointment,
then continued more briskly: “Can
you tell me, Mrs. Burnham, if you have any cherry
brandy in your wine cellar?”</p>

<p>“We had last year some cherry cordial—we call
it ‘Cherry Bounce’,” explained Mrs. Burnham; she
winced slightly as a peal of thunder echoed through
the house. “Would you mind pulling down the
curtains? I am deathly afraid of lightning—one of
my idiosyncrasies,” she added, and the coroner
hastened to pull the long curtains across the windows.</p>

<p>“Do you know whether any of this Cherry
Bounce was left in your cellar when you closed
the house for the summer, Mrs. Burnham?” inquired
Penfield, returning to them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burnham shook her head. “I really cannot
inform you; Mrs. Ward, my housekeeper, may be
able to tell you.” Mrs. Burnham changed her seat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
to one facing the doorway and with her back to
the windows. “Why do you want to know?”</p>

<p>“Because the dose of prussic acid, or to be exact,
hydrocyanic acid, which was used to poison the
unknown man, was administered in cherry brandy—or
cordial; it is practically the same thing,” explained
Penfield. “I am trying to find out if it was
possible for the murderer to have gotten those
ingredients in this house.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Burnham looked her astonishment. “By
ingredients do you mean the cordial or the poison?”
she questioned suavely, laying one hand on her bag
as it threatened to slip off her lap.</p>

<p>“The cordial.” Coroner Penfield took out his
memorandum book. “Not a thing apparently was
found out of place by you or any of your servants;
not even a chair misplaced; no soiled glasses, plates,
or cups; and yet the dead man and his companion
or companions must have been carousing together—it
is most extraordinary.”</p>

<p>“It is very evident they were not carousing here,”
replied Mrs. Burnham tartly. “You will have to
travel abroad to find the motive, the criminal, and
the scene of the crime.”</p>

<p>Evelyn looked up in quick rebuke. What did
her mother mean by her cryptic remark—to involve
René?</p>

<p>“Travel abroad,” repeated the coroner thoughtfully.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
“To some extent we have done that; a
warrant has been issued for the arrest of that
young French ‘Ace’, Captain La Montagne, and
we hope to have news of his whereabouts before
night.”</p>

<p>“You can have news of his whereabouts now,”
declared Evelyn before her mother could intervene.
“My fiancé, Captain La Montagne, is dining with
us to-night.”</p>

<p>“Your fiancé!” Penfield stared, astounded. “Do
you mean you are engaged to the man your step-father
accuses of the murder of this unknown
man?”</p>

<p>“I am,” proudly, “Captain La Montagne is
entirely innocent of any crime; on that I will stake
my reputation and if need be, my life.”</p>

<p>“<i>Mon coeur, mon coeur!</i>” exclaimed a passionate
voice from the hall and René La Montagne sped to
Evelyn’s side regardless of their presence and
kissed her again and again. With one arm encircling
her waist he faced the staggered coroner and
Mrs. Burnham, and addressed them in English.
“What Miss Preston states is true. I knew not
of the crime until I read of it in the newspapers; I
knew not the victim; I knew not this house until my
arrival a few minutes ago.”</p>

<p>Another figure hovering in the hall just outside
the door joined the group in the library.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>“What you say is true in every particular save
one, Captain,” stated Marian Van Ness clearly;
she paused and stepped to one side to let Detective
Mitchell and James Palmer enter. “You knew
the dead man.”</p>

<p>“I, madame?” La Montagne gazed at her incredulously.</p>

<p>“Yes.” Marian drew in her breath sharply; she
was keeping herself well in hand except for the
nervous twitching of her fingers. Her eyes roved
around the group—Dan Maynard was not there.
She passed her handkerchief across her lips. “Yes,
you knew him, Captain La Montagne,” she continued.
“He had often threatened your life.”</p>

<p>“Marian!” Evelyn’s anguish almost broke down
the other’s composure, but she continued to regard
the Frenchman steadily. None of the group about
her were aware of the butler’s approach until he
announced from the doorway:</p>

<p>“Dr. Hayden to see Miss Evelyn,” and Jones
stepped back to allow the physician to enter, but
curiosity kept him loitering near the door within
earshot. In his absorption in what was transpiring
in the library he never noticed the stealthy
approach of Mrs. Ward. The housekeeper, choosing
her opportunity with care, slipped unseen behind
one of the portières of the library door.</p>

<p>Hayden stopped on the threshold of the library<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
and gazed in amazement at the tense attitude of
Mrs. Burnham and her guests.</p>

<p>“Come in, doctor,” she said. “Mrs. Van Ness
is about to tell us——” her face was like paper—“the
name of the dead man.”</p>

<p>La Montagne, paying no attention to the others,
gazed intently at Marian.</p>

<p>“The man’s name, madame,” he demanded impetuously.
“Give us his name.”</p>

<p>“Count Fritz von Eltz,” responded Marian. An
oath escaped La Montagne while Mrs. Burnham
collapsed on a chair.</p>

<p>“Marian—you don’t mean—your husband?” she
gasped.</p>

<p>Marian’s face was like marble. “I do,” she
said. “He was my divorced husband; the courts
permitted me to resume my maiden name. I never
knew he was in this country until this morning.”</p>

<p>“I was not sure he was in Washington,” volunteered
La Montagne. “But I had heard, no matter
how, that he had come to America. Ours was a
quarrel of long standing, gentlemen; frankly, had
I met him I would have killed him at sight.”</p>

<p>“Hush, René!” and impulsively Evelyn clapped
her hand to his lips.</p>

<p>“<i>Non, non, mon coeur</i>; it is best I tell these
gentlemen of my animosity to Von Eltz. He was a
reptile; no crime was too revolting for his infernal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
cunning to undertake. The world is better without
him.”</p>

<p>“Was he a German spy?” asked Mitchell.</p>

<p>“But of course, monsieur.” La Montagne
laughed at the question. “Pouf! why waste time
discussing his death? Let us congratulate ourselves
and this fortunate lady in being free of him,” and
he bowed low to Marian.</p>

<p>“That’s all very heroic,” remarked Mitchell ironically.
“But we have laws in this country, Captain;
and we’ve got to abide by them. Somebody’s got
to be punished for murdering Von Eltz.”</p>

<p>A sudden shout from the next room startled
Evelyn and she swung about just as Mrs. Burnham,
her face ashen, started for the door leading into
her husband’s bedroom. A premonition of impending
evil made Evelyn follow her. The coroner,
speeding ahead, unlocked the door.</p>

<p>“Come,” Evelyn called over her shoulder to the
others and they flocked after her; Jones, bringing
up the rear of the little procession, almost collided
with James Palmer who lagged behind the others.</p>

<p>Peter Burnham, sitting up in bed, his hands
clutching numerous papers while others were scattered
loose over the counterpane, glared at his wife
and those back of her until he saw James Palmer;
then his expression changed to one of impotent
fury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>“You, Palmer——” his voice choked with rage—“it
was you who shot at me from the window in
your apartment, you treacherous hound!”</p>

<p>Palmer stared over the heads of his companions
and his expression caused Marian to shrink back.</p>

<p>“What’s that you say?” he demanded. “Here,
let me by,” and he pushed Hayden to one side as
he made his way to the foot of the bed. “Are you
out of your head, Burnham?”</p>

<p>“No. I’ve just found out to what use you have
put my chess correspondence. I have all the
evidence,” shouted Burnham, his excitement almost
uncontrollable. “I have discovered the key——”
A sudden sensation of suffocation overcame him
and he fell back on his pillow speechless, the papers
fluttering from his palsied fingers.</p>

<p>“Quick, doctor,” pleaded Mrs. Burnham, while
Detective Mitchell, his mind in a whirl, edged
nearer Palmer, at the same time keeping an alert
eye on René La Montagne who had drawn Evelyn
to one side and shielded her from the sight of the
pitiful figure on the bed.</p>

<p>Marian Van Ness started forward to aid Hayden,
but the sight of Mrs. Ward, her eyes agleam with
excitement, perspiration streaming down her face,
as she crept into the room, diverted her attention.
Back of Mrs. Ward came Jones, intent only on
watching the housekeeper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>Hayden, his quiet professional manner in striking
contrast to the excitement about him, prepared
some stimulant and then bent over Burnham. Slipping
his arm deftly under the unconscious man’s
head he lifted him up and placed the small glass to
his lips and tipped it slowly upward.</p>

<p>The next instant the glass was plucked from his
grasp and an iron hand hurled him to the floor.</p>

<p>“Quick, Mitchell, there’s your prisoner!” shouted
the man in the bed, and with leaping pulses and
reeling senses Marian recognized Dan Maynard’s
voice.</p>

<p>Tossing aside his make-up, Maynard set down
the glass he still held and collared the physician as
he struggled to his knees. “Your prisoner,” he
said tersely, as Mitchell sprang forward. “Lewis
Hayden, German spy and would-be murderer.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br>

<small>THE MISSING DIAGRAMS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MRS. BURNHAM was the first to arouse
from the stupor which had held her and
her companions equally silent.</p>

<p>“My husband!” she gasped. “Where is Peter?”
Maynard, relaxing his hold on his prisoner as
Mitchell slipped handcuffs on his wrists, swung
himself out of bed.</p>

<p>“There’s Burnham coming in the door now with
Chief Connor,” he stated, and all turned in that
direction. Burnham, his eyes half starting out of
his head, looked first at Hayden, then at La Montagne,
and last at James Palmer.</p>

<p>“Good God! Wasn’t it either La Montagne or
Palmer?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“La Montagne and Palmer are innocent,” announced
Maynard. “When I impersonated you,
Burnham, and not for the first time—” he smiled at
Hayden’s furious look—“I used Palmer as a stalking
horse. The announcement that I had the key
to the German’s cipher code did the trick. You
were quick, Hayden,” addressing the physician<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
whose ghastly face and horror-filled eyes testified
to his feelings. “It was infernally clever of you
to seize the opportunity to administer poison under
pretext of reviving a supposedly dying man, and
thus prevent his ever exposing you and the key
to the cipher.”</p>

<p>Coroner Penfield pressed forward. “Can you
prove it, Maynard?”</p>

<p>“Yes; examine that glass,” directed Maynard,
pointing to the one he had taken from the physician.
“Ah, Hayden, you slipped up in your cleverness—though
had I been the man you took me for,
you would have succeeded in poisoning me, and
right under the eyes of Coroner Penfield and Detective
Mitchell. God! man, why couldn’t you
remain straight, instead of resorting to trickery,
treachery, and murder!”</p>

<p>Hayden’s eyes fell before Maynard’s piercing
gaze and he stood in sullen silence. Coroner Penfield,
moving the medicine glass gently to and
fro, sniffed at its contents, and when he set the
glass down his face was white.</p>

<p>“Prussic acid!” he announced. “Enough to kill
you in three seconds if you had swallowed it, Maynard.”</p>

<p>“Yes. It was the unmistakable odor of the
poison which warned me as Hayden held it under
my nose.” Maynard took off Burnham’s dressing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
gown which he wore over his own clothes. “The
game is up, Hayden; you might as well confess.”</p>

<p>For the first time Hayden broke his silence.
“Confess to what?” he asked insolently. “I did
not murder you and I did not murder Count Fritz
von Eltz. You—” and his accusing voice rang
through the room—“you, Maynard, did that.”</p>

<p>Marian raised her hand to her lips to check the
cry of terror which almost escaped her as Mitchell
moved slightly toward Maynard.</p>

<p>“Your guess is wrong, Hayden,” answered Maynard
composedly. “I did not murder Von Eltz—he
killed himself.”</p>

<p>“A likely tale!” scoffed Hayden, with a return
of his habitual dictatorial manner.</p>

<p>“A true tale,” responded Maynard sternly. “I
admit Von Eltz did not intentionally commit suicide,
but he innocently drank the poison he had prepared
for me.”</p>

<p>“What!” chorused his listeners, and Hayden’s
stare of unbelief became one of baffled fury.</p>

<p>“I will make my explanations as brief as possible,”
began Maynard. “While in Europe I have
been of some assistance working for the Intelligence
Service of our Allies, my ability to disguise myself
and my experience as an actor being valuable aids
in my work.” He glanced at Marian, but her eyes
were downcast. “While in Switzerland my suspicions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
were aroused by the great frequency with
which chess problems were going and coming from
Germany—they have been allowed through the
mails from every country since the outbreak of
the world war.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” broke in Burnham impatiently.
“Chess problems are always interesting and help
the study of tactical problems by officers in war
time.”</p>

<p>“And chess has proved a valuable aid to Germany
in more ways than one,” remarked Maynard
dryly. “Realizing the use that might be made of
problem diagrams to a nation which excels in
cipher codes, I decided to look into the matter—and
from this end.”</p>

<p>“When was that?” asked Palmer, leaving his
place at the foot of the bed. “Can’t we have the
light switched on?” he added. “The storm is making
the room fearfully dark.”</p>

<p>Marian stepped back and pressed the wall button
and the room was flooded with light.</p>

<p>“Go on, Mr. Maynard,” directed Chief Connor.</p>

<p>“My suspicions were aroused a month ago and
I came to this country ostensibly to take part in
training camp activities. I remembered your interest
in chess, Burnham, and decided to ask your
aid; in fact sent a wireless when off New York
telling you I was coming to Washington.” Maynard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
paused to sip a glass of water, carefully avoiding
the medicine glass standing next it on the bed
stand. “I reached Washington Monday afternoon.”</p>

<p>Chief Connor nodded. “So I was informed by
the taxi-driver, Sam,” he said. “Sam had called to
lay information against you, Maynard, just before
your telephone came asking me to come here. Sam
is now under arrest.”</p>

<p>A piercing scream from Mrs. Ward drew all
eyes to the housekeeper, and Chief Connor addressed
her sternly.</p>

<p>“Sam finally confessed that he was your son,” he
stated. “And he implicated you in this far reaching
German plot which Mr. Maynard has unearthed
so cleverly. Sam confessed you had given him
duplicate keys of this house and that he had passed
them over for a consideration to a ‘party’ whose
name he would not divulge, even under pressure.”
Chief Connor turned to Hayden. “He meant <i>you</i>.”</p>

<p>“Did he?” Hayden smiled contemptuously.
“Prove it; there is no law which forces a suspected
party to incriminate himself.”</p>

<p>“We don’t need further proof,” interrupted Maynard
with significant emphasis. “Sam——”</p>

<p>“Had nothing to do with Count von Eltz’ death,”
declared Mrs. Ward vehemently, her bloodshot
eyes turning pleadingly to first one and then another.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
“Sam is a good boy, but led astray by——”
She stopped and bit her lip.</p>

<p>“I know he had nothing to do with the tragic
happenings on Monday night,” responded Maynard
quickly, taking pity on the woman’s evident agony.
“Let me complete my story. Upon my arrival, I
telephoned this house and a voice I did not recognize
told me that Mr. Burnham was out of town
but would be back in two days. I had seen in the
newspapers that La Montagne was in Washington
and hunted him up. At the Burlington I found the
desk clerk so busy that I got the number of your
room, René, from an elevator boy and went, unattended,
directly to it. I found the door open and
a charwoman just leaving. On explaining that I
was a friend of yours, she let me in and went
away.”</p>

<p>“She never told me that any one had called,”
exclaimed La Montagne.</p>

<p>“Forgot all about it probably,” went on Maynard.
“I got rather restless sitting still waiting
for you, and looked about for something to read.
A letter lying open with a key holding it down
attracted my attention.” Maynard flushed. “I don’t
usually read private correspondence, René, and you
must forgive the breach of manners, but on seeing
Burnham’s signature at the bottom of the page,
I took the liberty to glance down it, and his statement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
that he would be at his house that night, and
that he sent you the key to enter because the house
was <i>unoccupied</i>, instantly piqued my curiosity. The
statement was directly contrary to what I had
learned over the telephone half an hour before.
Acting on impulse I pocketed Burnham’s key and
left the apartment.”</p>

<p>“<i>Mon Dieu!</i>” ejaculated La Montagne in open-eyed
astonishment.</p>

<p>“In one of my disguises I went to Burnham’s
house that night,” went on Maynard. “It is some
years since I have been in Washington and in the
driving rainstorm I got confused and had to ask
how to find the house.”</p>

<p>“I was the person you asked,” stated Marian,
interrupting him. “Your voice—” she stopped and
continued softly—“your voice was familiar, but I
did not recognize you in your make-up. My
servant, Mammy, who was with me, answered your
question.”</p>

<p>“And I failed to recognize you in the storm for
you were so bundled up,” replied Maynard. “On
reaching this house I was admitted by a man I had
not seen for years, Count Fritz von Eltz. He had
attempted to conceal his identity by dying his hair
and shaving his beard and mustache, but his disguise
was badly done.” Maynard paused. “I gave
an assumed name and showed a faked telegram<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
from Burnham. I could see Von Eltz was doubtful
how to act; he dared not turn me away for fear
I might investigate his right to be in the house, and
he did the only thing he could—invited me in and
took me up to his quarters, saying Burnham had
permitted him to occupy the house in his absence.”</p>

<p>“He did!” Mrs. Burnham’s indignant interruption
caused Maynard to look at her. “Where was
he living in this house?”</p>

<p>“In the housekeeper’s suite of rooms on the
third floor,” explained Maynard, and Mrs. Ward
cowered back under their glances. “One thing and
then another led Shipman—that was the name Von
Eltz gave me—to suggest a game of chess and I
jumped at the opportunity. We played most of the
night, but during his many frequent absences, I
heard him at the telephone downstairs, presumably
trying to reach you, Hayden,” and the physician
clenched his fists in wrath.</p>

<p>“Pity you didn’t get the ’phone numbers he
was calling,” remarked Chief Connor.</p>

<p>“I didn’t try to get the numbers; another and
more imperative matter engaged my attention, in
his absence,” answered Maynard. “Among Von
Eltz’ papers I found a set of problem diagrams,
and on examining them the preponderance of pieces
to pawns struck my eyes, but this was explained
momentarily by the reflection that the composer had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
probably assigned himself a definite task which involved
a certain specified number of men. When
Von Eltz next absented himself from the room, I
went over the problem diagrams again.” Maynard
paused, and Burnham edged nearer, his eyes shining
with excitement.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption"><span class="smcap">White to Play and Mate in Three Moves.</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“One position had a white pawn on rook’s eighth,
another a white pawn on the king’s square,” continued
Maynard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>“One I would have passed as a misprint, a
hasty setting down of the wrong man, but
hardly two such errors in six diagrams, and I
concluded, weighing the presence of Von Eltz under
an assumed name in the house, that I had
stumbled on a very serious message coded in the
innocent disguise of chess problems.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_306">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_306.jpg" alt="White to Play and Mate in Four Moves">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption"><span class="smcap">White to Play and Mate in Four Moves.</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“What did you do then?” demanded Burnham.</p>

<p>“Continued to play the game,” answered Maynard.
“But before Von Eltz returned I insured his
sleeping soundly that night by pouring a small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
amount of diluted hyoscine, which I carry with me
for insomnia, in one of the liqueur glasses containing
cherry cordial which Von Eltz had brought upstairs
earlier in the evening.”</p>

<p>“Quite sure it was not hydrocyanic acid?” asked
Hayden, and both tone and manner were as insulting
as he could make them.</p>

<p>“Quite,” answered Maynard. “My idea was to
insure Von Eltz sleeping soundly while I ransacked
the house in search of other evidence of German
espionage and intrigue.”</p>

<p>“Just a moment,” Chief Connor broke in. “Did
Von Eltz bring up only two glasses of cordial?”</p>

<p>“Only two glasses, but a decanter of the cordial,”
responded Maynard. “He sipped his at intervals,
possibly as a bracer, but I drank sparingly. Frankly,
my mind was so engaged with the problem of
securing the chess diagrams without his suspecting
it, that I paid little attention to what he did. I
do remember, however, that previous to a vivid flash
of lightning, followed by terrific thunder, which put
out our lights temporarily, Von Eltz had refilled
both glasses, and at his urging I tossed off mine
just before I went to bed.”</p>

<p>“Well, what then?” demanded Hayden. The
strain was telling on him and he sought to hurry
Maynard’s leisurely speech.</p>

<p>“Then, contrary to my expectations, I slept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
heavily all night,” answered Maynard, unruffled by
his questioner’s manner. “On rising I went into
the sitting room, Von Eltz having insisted that I
should occupy his bed and he take the sofa there,
and I found him lying on the floor—dead.”</p>

<p>Coroner Penfield broke the silence that followed.
“When did you make this discovery?”</p>

<p>“About eight in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Good gracious! Were you hiding in the house
when I arrived at ten o’clock?” gasped Evelyn.</p>

<p>“No. I was stunned by my discovery, but half
awake, and my first thought was that I had inadvertently
given Von Eltz an overdose of hyoscine
and killed him,” explained Maynard. “In my confused
state of mind, I dressed immediately and
left the house, taking my suit case, which I had
brought with me, as well as the six chess
problem diagrams; first, however, I searched Von
Eltz’ body and found nothing—not even a pocket
handkerchief. I overlooked the string which you
discovered later, Penfield.”</p>

<p>“And which I promptly lost,” and the coroner
made a wry face.</p>

<p>“I took it unseen from your pocket when coming
out of my faint,” volunteered Mrs. Ward from
the background. “I was in mortal terror Sam was
mixed up in the man’s death and so I also
stole the ball of cord out of Mr. Burnham’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
library; I knew he used it to send his parcels
abroad, and I gave the cord to Sam. He told me,
Miss Evelyn, that he accidentally handed you a
piece from the ball when helping you gather up
your bundles.”</p>

<p>“So that was it!” and Evelyn sighed with relief;
the tangled skein was rapidly unwinding and
brighter hours seemed ahead with the clearing of
the mystery. “Where did you go after leaving
here, Mr. Maynard?”</p>

<p>“To the home of an old ‘dresser’ of mine who
is still employed in a local theater,” replied Maynard.
“He took me in without requiring explanations,
and after a bath and something to eat I was
again in condition to reason things out. I concluded
to return here that afternoon, await developments,
and if possible find out if Burnham
was in any way aiding the Germans by the loan of
his house, and by using his established reputation
as a chess expert to cloak their method of passing
valuable information in and out of Germany.”</p>

<p>“Heavens! I knew nothing of it!” gasped Burnham,
appalled. “I assure you, Maynard, I had
no idea——”</p>

<p>“I know that now,” acknowledged Maynard
quickly. “After my bath I went over the chess
problem diagrams again, and this time my examination
became more technical and its results increased<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
my suspicions of a code.” Maynard paused, and
took from his pocket small squares of paper and
laid them systematically in front of him on the bed.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>“Examining the top rank of each diagram from
left to right,” continued Maynard, “I noticed that
the first and fifth squares were the most frequently
occupied. This suggested that the squares represented
the first and fifth letters of the alphabet, the
important vowels a and e. Taking a blank diagram
I wrote out the twenty-six letters of the alphabet on
the squares in sequence, filling somewhat less than
the top half of the board. Then I chose the letters
indicated on the first diagram by the white pieces, in
the usually accepted order of their powers, King,
Queen, Castle, Bishop, Knight, and Pawn. I was
rewarded by the two startling words: ‘New gas’.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, go on,” pleaded Burnham, his excitement
outrunning Maynard’s deliberation of speech.</p>

<p>“The black pieces were not yet accounted for,”
went on Maynard. “So I repeated the alphabet a
second time, beginning with ‘a’ on the third square
from the left on the fourth rank from the top of
the board. This yielded the phrase: ‘New gas to
be us——’, and there I stuck,” he admitted. “I
floundered about hopelessly making little sense of
the remainder of the diagrams, and then I concluded
that I had failed to secure all the diagrams of the
set. That clinched my determination to return<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
here and search for other diagrams. I arrived, as
you know, just after Evelyn discovered Von Eltz’
body. With the pressing need of finding the
missing diagrams without betraying my knowledge
of their existence, I decided to keep my own counsel
and play a lone hand.”</p>

<p>“Did you get the missing diagrams?” demanded
Burnham.</p>

<p>“I found one among Palmer’s blue prints in his
office Friday afternoon——”</p>

<p>“You did!” Palmer shouted the interruption,
reddening hotly. “This is the first I have ever
heard of these diagrams——”</p>

<p>“I know it,” acknowledged Maynard. “You accidentally
carried the diagram off among your papers
from Hayden’s desk in your apartment, eh,
Hayden?” but the physician made no answer and
Maynard continued his explanation. “Frankly,
Palmer, on finding the diagram I thought you guilty
until—I’m sorry,” and Maynard glanced contritely
at Palmer, observing his hurt expression.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” he mumbled ungraciously. “What
about the diagram you found in my office?”</p>

<p>“It made seven diagrams in my possession,” responded
Maynard, “and applying the same key, I
then had half the message, but it was not until
Jones gave me a note from Mrs. Van Ness this
afternoon that I got the last diagram; here,” and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
taking a folded paper from his pocket he laid it
alongside the other diagrams and Burnham and
Palmer bent eagerly over them. “This is the message
coded there in its entirety: ‘New gas to be
used selenium fluoride. Ordinary absorbents useless.
Start Reichanstalt on search for antidote.’”</p>

<p>Marian turned impulsively to Maynard. “Well
done!” she exclaimed. “But I never sent you any
diagram.”</p>

<p>“Your message—” Maynard picked up the paper
and reversed it—“is written here. Where did you
get the paper?”</p>

<p>“I gave it to her,” spoke up Jones, edging slightly
forward. “It was on the hall table.”</p>

<p>“That was where I found the bundle of diagrams
which I gave Mr. Burnham yesterday,” volunteered
Evelyn. “Perhaps I dropped one there; the package
was not tied.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps, but—” Maynard eyed Hayden attentively—“investigation
proved pretty conclusively,
Burnham, that your innocent chess correspondence
was being tampered with and used to forward and
receive coded problem diagrams. It was clever
work, Hayden, but you blundered badly when you
attempted to shoot Burnham on Thursday night.”</p>

<p>“I did not,” declared Hayden vehemently. “Even
you, Maynard, must admit I sat by his side at the
table. The shot came from the balcony.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>“It did—when you pressed the electric button,”
stated Maynard, and his words created a sensation.
“A very neat contrivance you rigged up in the
wicker bird-cage lantern; its small open door attracted
no attention on that pitch dark night, and
the revolver in it was completely hidden.”</p>

<p>Hayden moved restlessly. “A pleasant fairy-tale,”
he muttered.</p>

<p>“No, gospel truth,” retorted Maynard. “In yours
and Palmer’s absence this morning I made a
thorough examination of your apartment, your
Jap, Siki, taking me for Burnham in my disguise.
I aided him in removing the electric
wires which had been used to hold the revolver in
the lantern and connected with the trigger; also, I
took full note of the fact that the lantern, by aid of
a pulley on which it swings, can be raised or lowered
at will. The electric current which pressed the trigger
was supplied and controlled by the electric
wires running from the bell attached to the dining
table and the pantry. That was the bell the Jap
heard when you fired the revolver at Burnham.”</p>

<p>“Was it?” snarled Hayden. “Your statement is
not borne out by facts. Fully five minutes elapsed
before Palmer and Burnham rushed into the hall
after the shooting and they found Siki answering
the bell then, which had just rung.”</p>

<p>“Siki distorted the truth to shield his negligence,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
replied Maynard. “On investigation I found he
was out on the fire-escape talking to your neighbor’s
pretty cook, and he was late in answering the bell
in consequence.”</p>

<p>“I am glad Siki’s leaving,” declared Palmer.
“If he had been prompt that night La Montagne
might have been spared some uneasy moments.” He
shrugged his shoulders and looked away from
Evelyn; he could not bear with equanimity just
then her happy face as she stood by her lover.
“I noticed the lantern hung pretty low that night
but never gave it another thought. It swings directly
in front of the balcony window.”</p>

<p>“And right in line with where Burnham sat,”
added Maynard. “I made another interesting discovery,
Hayden, in your apartment, the significance
of which I did not recognize until later, and that
was magic lantern slides on which was drawn in
colors a picture of this string,” taking the familiar
red and green cord from his pocket, “and a very
excellent likeness of Von Eltz sitting dead in his
chair. I also saw that Palmer’s window was at
such an angle that the slides could be thrown
directly in Evelyn’s bedroom. It was a bit of deviltry
which, frankly, infuriated me.”</p>

<p>“Thank God it was no illusion on my part!”
exclaimed Evelyn fervently. “But, Mother, you
must have seen the dead man as well as I?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>Mrs. Burnham blushed hotly. “I did,” she confessed.
“But I recognized the man as one who had
traveled to Chelsea to blackmail my husband; and,
God forgive me, I feared Mr. Burnham had met
him here and, in a moment of desperation, poisoned
him with some of the hydrocyanic acid which
had been prescribed for stomach disorders for him
when we were in Florida last winter. I knew the
bottle was in the house somewhere, that we had
plenty of cherry cordial, and that Mr. Burnham
had left for Washington on Monday.”</p>

<p>Burnham, who had listened with increasing
anxiety, exclaimed hurriedly: “My train did not
reach here until early Tuesday morning and I went
to a Turkish bath and later got my breakfast and
lunch down town; then came up to this house, saw
the windows opened, and on entering went directly
to the library and rang for Jones, supposing he was
downstairs. Glancing about the library I saw the
dead man, Von Eltz, or Shipman, as I knew him;
realized I had promised to meet him that afternoon;
that I had threatened to make trouble if he
blackmailed me again, and not stopping to think
bolted out of the house and into the taxi which was
still standing at the curb.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t understand how the dead man got
in the library,” exclaimed Evelyn.</p>

<p>Hayden raised his head and addressed them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
sullenly. “I carried him there,” he admitted.
“There’s a side entrance to our apartment house
which opens directly on your court, Burnham, and
with the pass-keys which Sam gave me, I could
enter this house at any hour unobserved. I came
in about two o’clock Tuesday and stole upstairs to
Von Eltz’ usual quarters and found him lying there
dead. It was a fearful shock.” Hayden passed his
hand across his mouth. “I was uncertain whether
Von Eltz had committed suicide or been murdered,
or who had murdered him. I decided to destroy
all evidence of his having occupied the rooms, and
did so; no very difficult job, as Von Eltz had planned
to go on Tuesday anyway, and we had sent away
practically everything.”</p>

<p>“Why did you carry the body into the library?”
asked Maynard.</p>

<p>“I was carrying it into the basement intending
to destroy it with quick-lime,” explained Hayden.
“Hearing some one, Evelyn, I found out later, moving
about downstairs, I gave up my original plan,
propped the body in the chair in the library and
disappeared. Mitchell,” turning to the detective,
“I have committed no crime. Take off these handcuffs.”</p>

<p>“Wait,” directed Chief Connor, as Mitchell
stared uncertainly at his prisoner and at Maynard.
“Turn Dr. Hayden over to the Department of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
Justice officials, Mitchell. You have been guilty of
high treason, sir, and must pay the penalty. Sam,
the taxi-driver, states Von Eltz brought you the
Iron Cross for your work.” Mitchell took out from
his pocket the decoration which he had found
at the theater and Hayden winced. “Sam,” continued
Connor, “has sworn to still more revolting
crimes on your part. Take, for instance, the suit
case——”</p>

<p>“It was only filled with quick-lime,” broke in
Hayden. “I asked Mrs. Ward to give it to her
son——”</p>

<p>“And to mark the suit case with Mr. Maynard’s
initials,” completed Connor dryly. “Your machinations
involved every one you came in contact with;
a scientifically educated criminal is a double menace
to public welfare. Go with Mitchell.”</p>

<p>Hayden stood motionless for one long minute,
then with eyes averted he walked out of the room,
his former companions falling back to let him
pass. Mrs. Ward, back in her corner, was startled
by Mitchell’s hand on her shoulder.</p>

<p>“You are to come with us,” he said, and without
a backward glance the housekeeper followed the
detective and Hayden from the house.</p>

<p>For a moment after their departure the silence
was absolute; then Maynard, drawing a long
breath, faced the Chief of the Secret Service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>“The strain is over,” he said thankfully. “I really
thought I had killed Von Eltz with an accidental
overdose of hyoscine until you announced, Coroner
Penfield, that he had died from hydrocyanic acid;
then for the first time I realized he must have
penetrated my disguise, attempted to poison me
and inadvertently mixed the glasses and drank the
dose he prepared for me.”</p>

<p>Marian’s low “Thank God!” reached only Mrs.
Burnham, and that astute dame, catching her expression,
acted with promptness.</p>

<p>“It’s been a horrible six days,” she confessed,
“with every one suspecting every one else. Evelyn,
if you hurry, you can catch the Society Editors at
their office. Tell them to put in the morning newspapers
that <i>Mr.</i> and Mrs. Peter Burnham announce
your engagement to Captain René La Montagne
and that the marriage will take place next month.”</p>

<p>“Mother!” Evelyn’s arms flew about her and
she gave her a most undignified hug. “Bless you,”
and La Montagne gratefully kissed her hand; then
the two young lovers hurried from the room.</p>

<p>Burnham went up to his wife. “Lillian,” his
voice broke. “I haven’t deserved your faith and
your splendid loyalty; but Hayden led me to believe
that I was developing a tendency to homicidal
mania; there is a taint in our family, my uncle
died insane. Hayden loaned me books on poisons,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>
suggested that La Montagne would do me physical
injury, and so worked upon me that I even took
underhand methods, such as forging Evelyn’s name
on receipts of La Montagne’s letters and suppressing
the letters from her. I cannot forgive myself
for the harm I might have done.”</p>

<p>“Hush! don’t blame yourself too much, Peter.”
Mrs. Burnham colored. “Dr. Hayden made quite
as big a fool of me,” as the memory of her interview
that morning occurred to her. “Must you go,
Dr. Penfield?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” The coroner picked up the medicine glass
containing prussic acid. “With your permission,
Maynard, I’ll take this for laboratory examination.”</p>

<p>“Wait for me downstairs, Penfield,” called Chief
Connor as the others started for the door. “Mr.
Maynard, you have done fine work; rest assured
no more coded chess problems will go to or come
from Germany. Thanks and congratulations,” and
he wrung his hand, bowed to Marian Van Ness and
left the room.</p>

<p>Marian turned to accompany him when Maynard
rose from his chair and detained her.</p>

<p>“Marian.” His always charming voice took its
most tender tone. “All is not said between you
and me. Did you mean your brief message on the
back of the chess diagram? It went straight to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
my heart to have you say: ‘I need you.’ <i>Do</i> you
need me, dear?”</p>

<p>“I—I—” Marian hesitated and her color rose—“I
was greatly troubled; I lost my identification card
admitting me to the State Department, and—and
the missing blotter frightened me——”</p>

<p>“Do not fear.” Maynard smiled brightly down at
her averted face. “Dr. Hayden was the thief probably;
Siki showed me this morning skeleton keys
of every apartment in the building. However, they
were concealed in Palmer’s room, which led me to
believe that Palmer was the traitor. Let us forget
it all.” He caught her hand in his. “Dearest, when
I asked you after your divorce to marry me——”</p>

<p>“Dan—Dan—” she cried, brokenly—“I couldn’t
do it—then——”</p>

<p>“And you never answered my letters——”</p>

<p>“I didn’t dare; I was afraid I’d say too much.”</p>

<p>“Say it now,” he pleaded and his whisper,
“Sweetheart,” found its echo on her lips.</p>
